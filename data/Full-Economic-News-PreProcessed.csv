Negative,"NEW YORK -- Yields on most certificates of deposit offered by major banks dropped more than a tenth of a percentage point in the latest week, reflecting the overall decline in short-term interest rates.</br></br>On small-denomination, or ""consumer,"" CDs sold directly by banks, the average yield on six-month deposits fell to 5.49% from 5.62% in the week ended yesterday, according to an 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a Wilmington, Del., information service.</br></br>On three-month ""consumer"" deposits, the average yield sank to 5.29% from 5.42% the week before, according to Banxquote. Two banks in the Banxquote survey, Citibank in New York and CoreStates in Pennsylvania, are paying less than 5% on threemonth small-denomination CDs.</br></br>Declines were somewhat smaller on five-year consumer CDs, which eased to 7.37% from 7.45%, Banxquote said.</br></br>Yields on three-month and six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction plummeted more than a fifth of a percentage point from the previous week, to 5.46% and 5.63%, respectively."
Negative,"Stocks declined, as investors weighed slower-than-expected domestic economic growth and continued euro-zone concerns against signs the Federal Reserve may take new steps to bolster the economy.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.59 points, or 0.5%, to 11493.72, its lowest close since Oct. 17.</br></br>Weighing on the downside were Alcoa, which dropped 21 cents, or 2.2%, to $9.26, and Bank of America, which fell 12 cents, or 2.2%, to 5.37.

Negative,"NEW YORK -- The dollar sagged yesterday, as news of a widely anticipated 0.50-percentage point rate increase by the Federal Reserve provided an excuse to take profits on Tuesday's powerful dollar rally.</br></br>The dollar also was depressed by the sell-off in U.S. Treasurys that followed the Fed's action, with bond-market participants concerned that U.S. economic growth will remain buoyant and thus prompt further Fed rate boosts.</br></br>The Federal Reserve decided at its policy-setting meeting yesterday to lift to 6% its Fed funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed also raised to 5.25% the discount rate, or the rate at which it sells money to banks.</br></br>Explaining its decision, the Fed said that ""despite tentative signs of some moderation in growth, economic activity has continued to advance at a substantial pace.""</br></br>Traders, who had amassed dollars on Tuesday with the announcement of President Clinton's new aid package for Mexico, abruptly dumped them when the Fed made its announcement. The dollar fell quickly to intraday lows of 1.5150 marks and 98.85 yen within minutes of the Fed's statement; it recovered a little later in the session."
Positive,"The technology industry, an engine of innovation and U.S. prosperity for more than half a century, is accelerating its recovery from the recession with surging earnings that have spurred companies to sharply ramp up their hiring.</br></br>The latest evidence for the rebound came Thursday, when Internet giant Google Inc. posted a 37% profit jump for the first quarter and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a 34% revenue increase to record levels. The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp., which Tuesday announced quarterly profit that nearly quadrupled on a 44% jump in sales.</br></br>The trio of results kicks off what is likely to be a strong earnings streak as tech spending by companies and consumers picks up. Next week, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., among others, are slated to report quarterly results. Tech-research firm ISI Group projects that overall revenues from such companies will rise more than 10% for the first quarter, compared with a 16% decline a year earlier. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's forecasts a 79% increase in tech earnings for the quarter from year-ago levels.</br></br>The growth has reached a level where tech companies are pushing to hire again, in some cases engaging in heated competition for talent. That's a turnabout for the industry, which had a series of layoffs last year, when some tech giants, notably Microsoft Corp., had mass layoffs for the first time.</br></br>The hiring ramp-up began late last year, with demand for tech goods and services stabilizing after months of declines. At the time, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said the Mountain View, Calif., company was ready to spend again, including on new recruits. On Thursday, Google said it hired 786 new employees in the first quarter and was just getting started."
Negative,"WASHINGTON--The breakdown in deficit-reduction talks between the White House and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) could immediately increase the risk that Standard & Poor's takes the unprecedented step of lowering its top-notch rating of U.S. government debt.</br></br>The credit-rating firm has warned repeatedly that it could move to downgrade U.S. debt if it believes any deficit-reduction deal isn't robust enough to change the country's trajectory of future debt growth. A downgrade could come even if officials agree to raise the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials have set that as the deadline because after that date, without more borrowing authority, the government could run out of cash to pay all its bills.</br></br>Messrs. Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth. It also could lower the value of Treasury securities held as assets by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other investors around the world, potentially shaking financial markets.</br></br>Now that the large-scale talks have broken down, policy makers will likely pursue a smaller-scale deal that falls short of S&P's targets. Mr. Obama alluded to this possibility Friday evening.</br></br>""If we can't come up with a serious plan for actual deficit and debt reduction, and all we're doing is extending the debt ceiling for another six, seven, eight months, then the probabilities of downgrading U.S. credit are increased, and that will be an additional cloud over the economy and make it more difficult for us and more difficult for businesses to create jobs that the American people so desperately need,"" Mr. Obama said Friday evening."
Negative,"U.S. wholesale prices sank further last month, a sign of how quickly the inflationary pressures of last summer have reversed.</br></br>Producer prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9% in December from the previous month, the Labor Department said, led by lower energy prices. It marks the fifth-straight monthly decline and a stunning reversal in just a few short months from the price pressures seen in mid-2008.</br></br>The lower prices bring some much-needed relief to hard-pressed businesses as the U.S. recession marches on -- but they also reflect weakness in global demand for goods. Manufacturing activity is down sharply in the world's biggest economies, including the U.S., Japan and Europe; it also has slowed in markets like China that once had enormous demand for raw materials. U.S. producer prices in December were down 0.9% from the previous year, the biggest yearly drop since 2001.</br></br>Energy prices fell 9.3% last month from November, as wholesale gasoline prices tumbled 25.7%. Food prices declined 1.5%. The declines are expected to be passed on to consumers, as businesses work to attract customers through heavy discounting. The Labor Department will release its December consumer prices on Friday.</br></br>Excluding food and energy, core producer prices held up last month, rising 0.2% from November and 4.3% from the previous year -- the largest annual gain in two decades. But core prices are expected to decline in the months ahead, which, combined with falling wages, is stoking concerns about a looming downward spiral of lower prices and spending known as deflation."
Negative,"[Today's Market Forecast]</br></br>Mortal Coil</br></br>The good news about last year's flat stock market? Stocks got cheaper. The bad news? They could get cheaper still.</br></br>In 2005, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had one of the most uninspiring annual performances of its 109-year history, finishing the year down 0.6% -- which is to say almost perfectly flat. The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.</br></br>But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005. Because the S&P 500 went up less than its earnings, it's price/earnings ratio slipped. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 16.4 times 2005 earnings. It finished 2004 at 18 times that year's earnings. In fact, it's the lowest S&P 500 P/E ratio in 10 years."
Positive,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Use of stock-options contracts to hedge stock portfolios and speculate in the market is surging, pushing options trading to levels not seen since the 1987 stock-market crash.</br></br>Investor wariness as the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to set records has helped bring new life to this previously moribund sector of the U.S. financial markets, as has the protracted takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc.</br></br>""This long, drawn-out tender offer has proven to be very profitable for the options business,"" said Michael Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. ""But there also has been a steady turnaround in the business, with an influx of new users and a change of direction from index options to equity options.""</br></br>Many participants attending the Chicago Board Options Exchange convention here this weekend are wondering how long the nation's four major options exchanges can maintain their momentum.</br></br>Before last month, when these markets posted their highest daily and monthly volume totals in more than five years, the consensus in the U.S. options industry was that it had never really recovered from the crash. Thousands of overly aggressive investors, who used options contracts in risky, leveraged trading strategies, had been devastated in the 1987 cataclysm. And options trading fell sharply in the years that followed."
Negative,"Continued concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy got the better of stocks yesterday, as sharp increases in Cisco Systems and Charles River Laboratories International were more than offset by Hospira's plunge and home builder Toll Brothers delivering an affirmation that conditions are cooling.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 97.41, or 0.87%, to 11076.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.57, or 0.03%, to 2060.28, with its loss mitigated by Cisco's influence on the tech group. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index shed 5.53, or 0.43%, to 1265.95. This was the fourth loss in a row for the three averages.</br></br>""We started off in pretty good shape but couldn't hang on as concerns about the economy hobbled us,"" said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist with Edward Jones. ""It's clear that 17 rate hikes are taking a bite out of industry sectors.""</br></br>Still, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq) jumped $2.49, or 14%, to $19.78, boosting its market value by more than $15 billion in its biggest percentage advance in more than four years. The maker of routers, switches and other apparatus that connect computers to the Internet late Tuesday reported strong fourth-quarter results, buoyed by solid orders. It projected revenue would increase 15% to 20% for fiscal 2007.</br></br>The robust report lifted Cisco's rivals, as well. Juniper Networks (Nasdaq) rose 49 cents, or 3.8%, to 13.41, Alcatel's American depositary receipts gained 22 cents, or 2%, to 11.12, and Lucent Technologies, set to merge with Alcatel, advanced six cents, or 2.9%, to 2.11."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees.</br></br>And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.</br></br>The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the ""strength in the U.S. economy"" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.</br></br>As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.</br></br>The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade."
Negative,"WASHINGTON -- The first significant sign that the economy is cooling emerged when the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate rose for the first time in more than a year.</br></br>The unemployment rate for January jumped 0.3 percentage point to 5.7%, matching October's level. The Labor Department also reported that employers created only 134,000 jobs last month, about half the pace of previous months and the smallest gain in a year.</br></br>While economists were careful to note that the new data suggest the economy is still growing, many agreed the report seems to indicate the year-long series of interest-rate rises engineered by the Federal Reserve finally have kicked in.</br></br>""It takes about 12 months for the rate hikes to have an effect,"" said Edward Yardeni, an economist at C.J. Lawrence. ""This is the year we'll see it happen.""</br></br>The financial markets rallied on the news as investors speculated that interest rates may soon stop rising. Bond prices rose; the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 7.62% from 7.74%. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 57.87 to 3928.64."
Positive,"NEW YORK -- Anyone who questions the remarkable relationship that binds the economy and the stock market should ponder briefly the circumstances that immediately preceded the recent surge in share prices. On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.</br></br>There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.</br></br>In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.</br></br>The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.</br></br>The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains."
Negative,"NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak.</br></br>A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed $4.73, or 13%, to $33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9%, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9%, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9%, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq.</br></br>The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the central bank's seventh rate cut this year.</br></br>Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed's decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7%, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4% during the short term, given the recent technical patterns.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4% drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12."
Negative,"The old dragon of inflation -- thought to have been slain -- may be lurking.</br></br>Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.</br></br>It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.</br></br>Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.</br></br>But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it. ""Industry sectors are trying to recoup what they gave up in the depth of the downturn,"" said Mark Steinkrauss, vice president of investor relations for Fruit of the Loom Inc. The company raised prices 5% on a line of T-shirts at the start of the year."
Negative,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Firefighter Brian Endicott got an early taste of the pension battle brewing here when a man at the grocery store angrily pointed to the steaks in his cart.</br></br>""Who do you think you are, wasting taxpayers' money on a meal like this?"" the man yelled at 46-year-old Mr. Endicott, who was shopping for dinner with three other firefighters from San Jose Fire Station No. 1.</br></br>After the 2001 terrorist attacks, sympathetic residents of this affluent city gathered at the firehouse to offer flowers, cakes and pies. Today, public sentiment toward the men and women in uniform has widely shifted, as many locals are up in arms over escalating pension costs for public-safety workers.</br></br>In the current fiscal year ending June 30, San Jose's retirement obligations soared to $245 million, up from $73 million a decade ago, according to the city. For police officers and firefighters who have retired since 2007, the average pension is $95,336, making them among the most generously compensated in the state.</br></br>Since the recession, dozens of state legislatures and city councils across the U.S. have scaled back benefits and jobs in an attempt to plug gaping budget holes. Safety workers like police and firefighters -- who generally earn more than librarians and garbage haulers -- have often been spared from some of the most drastic cuts."
Positive,"NEW YORK -- Microsoft's strong profit stirred enthusiasm for technology stocks.</br></br>Microsoft (Nasdaq) jumped 5 15/16 to 92 1/4 after the software company issued fiscal first-quarter earnings late Tuesday that topped analysts' forecasts. Salomon Smith Barney, praising what it called a ""pristine"" profit statement, bumped up its fiscal 2000 profit estimate for the company.</br></br>""They played off those Microsoft numbers from the opening bell, and we've seen some good follow-through in the technology sector,"" said John Manahan, head of trading at Brown Brothers Harriman.</br></br>Gateway rose 5 1/8 to 52, Hewlett-Packard gained 2 13/16 to 76 9/16, and Apple Computer climbed 6 5/8 to 75 1/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Even Dell Computer moved higher, gaining 1 1/2 to 40 on Nasdaq. Dell had stirred some profit worries for the technology sector when it warned earlier this week its results would be hurt by rising prices for memory products.</br></br>Strong profit performances from other technology issues contributed to the optimism evident in the session. Computer Associates gained 3 3/4 to 58 1/4 after its fiscal second-quarter profit, released late Tuesday, proved a penny a share better than analysts anticipated."
Negative,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate Finance Committee approved legislation to extend until next March emergency unemployment benefits that otherwise shut down July 4.</br></br>Workers who have exhausted normal state unemployment benefits would be eligible for either 26 or 33 weeks of additional emergency benefits under the plan, depending upon the unemployment rate in their state. The number of weeks could be reduced, however, if the national unemployment rate, currently 7.5%, drops below 7% for two consecutive months.</br></br>The finance panel's plan is far closer to administration proposals than the version passed Tuesday by House Democrats. The House bill would offer up to 26 weeks of emergency jobless benefits. Both jobless packages, however, face administrative opposition.</br></br>The $5.4 billion cost of the legislation approved yesterday would be covered by eight tax-raising measures. One provision would require securities dealers to pay taxes on the year-end market value of their portfolios, rather than on the value at purchase. Another provision would bar new owners of failed thrifts from deducting losses for which the federal government has compensated them since March 4, 1991, a practice known as double-dipping.</br></br>Both of these tax provisions were part of President Bush's budget proposal this year. Another measure would require large corporations to pay their quarterly taxes based on 96% of their estimated yearly income, up from 95%."

Negative,"NEW YORK -- A flurry of weak economic data helped to end a three-day stock market rally that had taken its cue from sharply lower interest rates.</br></br>Nearly every sector came under pressure as a series of economic reports reignited worries that the economy continues to falter. The reports showed a decrease in new home sales last month, a downturn in consumer confidence, and a drop in the index of May's leading economic indicators. Economists had expected higher readings for all of the figures.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to make a slight comeback near the close, which traders attributed to endof-the-quarter mark ups.

Negative,"A week of troubling economic data helped push fixed mortgage interest rates to a new low for the year, representing the seventh consecutive weekly decline, according to the latest survey from Freddie Mac.</br></br>Surveys of national consumer confidence and manufacturing activity in the past month have suggested the economy may be slowing, said Freddie Mac Chief Economist Frank Nothaft. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, meanwhile, showed first-quarter home prices fell by the steepest annual rate since the third quarter of 2009.</br></br>""Fixed mortgage rates followed U.S. Treasury yields lower this week amid financial market concerns that the current lull in the economy is continuing,"" Mr. Nothaft said.</br></br>The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.55% in the week ended Thursday, down from 4.60% the prior week and 4.79% a year earlier.

Positive,"With oil prices easing and the uncertainties of the election past, U.S. consumers show early signs of becoming more confident about the economic outlook.</br></br>The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index -- based on surveys conducted before and after the Nov. 2 election -- rose to a reading of 95.5 from 91.7 in October and 94.2 in September. In addition to the drop of oil prices below $50 a barrel and the resolution of a bitterly fought presidential campaign, the government reported recently that hiring in October was stronger than expected, all factors that should underpin confidence.</br></br>""Consumers will remain spending-minded,"" said Richard Curtin, the Michigan economist who oversees the confidence survey. He said the recent decline in oil prices was probably the key factor behind the improvement.</br></br>Households were spending-minded in October, though their pattern of spending showed signs of changing from the month before. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales in October rose 0.2% from September on a seasonally adjusted basis, after a 1.6% jump the month before. The back-to-back gains put household consumption on solid footing going into the holiday season.</br></br>One retailer that enjoyed steady gains in spending was Men's Wearhouse Inc., a Houston seller of men's suits with an average price of about $280.

Positive,"NEW YORK -- The economy continues to edge higher, and the consensus forecast is that the gains will continue, at least through 1988. The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.</br></br>That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?</br></br>It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be ""acceptable."" It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.</br></br>But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.</br></br>Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?"
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's index of leading indicators moved up slightly in March, signaling that U.S. economic expansion probably will continue vigorously through 1998.</br></br>Michael D. Boldin, director of business-cycle research at the New York business-research organization, said the economic omens point to continued strong growth in gross domestic product in the months ahead.</br></br>""It looks like above 3% is not impossible for the whole year,"" Mr. Boldin said. Last week, the government reported that the economy expanded in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 4.2%, but few economists believe that pace is sustainable through the rest of the year. The leading-indicators index, considered a reasonable predictor of turning points in the economy, measured 105.2, up from 105 in February.</br></br>The March increase came largely from two of the 10 components that make up the index: stock prices and money supply. Both of those measures reflect the strength of financial markets and are considered fairly reliable indicators of the strength of future economic growth, not just of whether the economy will stay out of recession.</br></br>Other increases were seen in orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a measure of suppliers' delivery times. Declines were seen in big-ticket orders to manufacturers, excluding defense contracts."

Negative,"The U.S. dollar declined against major foreign currencies yesterday because of lower U.S. interest rates, which make dollar-denominated investments less attractive, and a larger-than-expected decline of 0.9% in U.S. July retail sales.</br></br>The foreign-exchange market had expected July retail sales to advance by about 0.3%, said Gil Leiendecker Jr., a vice president and manager of the foreign-exchange department of Salomon Brothers Inc., New York. The drop indicated the U.S. economy is slowing faster than expected.</br></br>Gold rose $4.20 an ounce in response to the decline of the dollar and U.S. interest rates, which make gold purchases easier to finance.</br></br>Jordan Black, an assistant treasurer of Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said the feeling that U.S. interest rates might continue to ease also hurt the dollar. ""But people are hesitant to sell too many dollars,"" he added, ""in the belief that the Federal Reserve may have to tighten credit conditions in the period just after the U.S. election."" Any tightening could lead to higher U.S. interest rates.</br></br>Peter Rogers, an assistant vice president and assistant chief foreign-exchange dealer of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said that ""if we don't see a strong rise in the U.S. industrial production number (to be released today), there could be a substantial correction in the dollar."" The market curently expects U.S. July industrial production to climb by about 0.7%. ""My feeling,"" he said, ""is that short-term sentiment about the strength of the dollar has changed."""
Negative,"Easy Money Tugs Two Ways at Trade Gap</br></br>The trade deficit is a case study in the unintended consequences of easy money.</br></br>The Commerce Department releases April trade data Wednesday morning. Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.</br></br>A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.</br></br>Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The economy grew at a strong 4.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said, rather than the 3.9% rate estimated by the agency last month.</br></br>The large revision in the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services, was due principally to an unexpected reduction in December's trade deficit from the earlier estimate. For its earlier GNP report, the department had estimated that the December trade deficit would approach $10 billion, but in fact the deficit, as reported three weeks ago, was $8.2 billion. The deficit is a negative factor in calculating the GNP.</br></br>Most analysts believe the easing in the trade deficit is temporary, resulting from the economy's slowdown in the third quarter. They expect the rapid growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, combined with the continued strength of the dollar, to cause the deficit to get even larger next year.</br></br>The economy grew at a sluggish 1.6% rate in the third quarter. GNP in the fourth quarter of 1984 was 5.9% over the fourth quarter of 1983, rather than 5.6% as reported last month. And the full-year's output was 6.9% higher than in 1983, rather than 6.8% as previously reported.</br></br>The strong growth in the fourth quarter makes it clear that the economy began 1985 with considerable momentum."
Negative,"Stocks fell after a trio of disappointing economic readings overshadowed better-than-expected earnings reports from Travelers and other companies.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 68.65 points, or 0.53%, to 12964.10.

Negative,"NEW YORK -- A weaker dollar and heavy selling by some foreign investors depressed long-term bonds, while short-term securities rose amid continued speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease credit policies.</br></br>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 5/8 point, or about $6.25 per $1,000 face amount. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.13% from 8.06% Monday. Meanwhile, bond-equivalent yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.02% from an average of 8.24% at the government's auction on Monday.</br></br>As a result, the 30-year bonds now yield more than three-month Treasury bills for the first time since May 23. This relationship, in which short-term rates drop below long-term rates, is known as a ""positive yield curve"" and is often viewed as a sign that investors are expecting stable or possibly higher long-term interest rates down the road.</br></br>If the positive yield curve remains that way, it could also signal that the powerful bond market rally ""may be close to its end,"" said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.</br></br>The yield curve had been ""inverted"" for most of the past three months. That's an unusual configuration where long-term bond yields stand below the yields on short-term Treasury bills."
Positive,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. boosted its August sales-growth forecast and said it may post its largest monthly sales gain in more than a year, a sign that consumer spending continues to accelerate despite setbacks such as the blackout that struck much of the Northeast and Midwest two weeks ago.</br></br>The world's largest retailer said sales at stores open more than a year should increase 4% to 6%, somewhat better than its previous estimate of 3% to 5%. Although modest, the sales gains would be the largest such increase for the retailing giant in more than a year.</br></br>The improved forecast is the latest evidence that a nascent economic recovery is under way. Although battered by terrorism, war and economic uncertainty following the collapse of the Internet bubble, consumer spending has been a mainstay of the weak U.S. economy, fueled most recently by low interest rates that sparked a home-refinancing boom.</br></br>Wal-Mart attributed the improved forecast to a greater-than-expected number of shoppers and larger average purchases, bolstered by a cut in tax withholding and tax-refund checks of as much as $400 a child.</br></br>""People seem to be more inclined to shop right now,"" said Tom Williams, a spokesman for the Bentonville, Ark., discount retailer."
Negative,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit increase in May raised concerns about the strength of the nation's export market.</br></br>The trade gap grew to $7.38 billion from April's revised deficit of $7.06 billion, the Commerce Department said. It was the third month in a row that the trade gap has widened, and placed it at its largest level in a year and a half.</br></br>The May deficit is troublesome because of a substantial drop in exports, which have been largely credited with helping to lead the nation back to economic health. But as other nations struggle with their own economic problems, their demand for U.S. goods slackens.</br></br>Exports totaled $35.49 billion in May, down 2.5% from April. The drop reflected decreases in overseas sales of foods, capital goods and automotive vehicles, parts and engines.</br></br>The drop in capital goods reflected a large decline in sales of civilian aircraft, which fell more than 28%."
Negative,"NEW YORK -- Prices of Treasury bonds slumped yesterday as dealers and investors were shaken by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar's value against other major currencies.</br></br>Some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell more than half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the weekly auction of Treasury bills, but most other short-term rates rose.</br></br>Adding to investor jitters was a rise in the price of oil. Prices of gold and other precious metals viewed as harbingers of inflation also rose.</br></br>""Investors are growing increasingly concerned that the dollar's weakness could make foreigners reluctant to buy dollar-denominated securities,"" said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. Foreign investors have purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds in recent years, helping the U.S. government finance its huge budget deficits.</br></br>Furthermore, a continued drop in the dollar might rekindle inflationary pressures and cause the Federal Reserve not to ease credit, some investment managers say. Analysts generally have been expecting the Fed to drive interest rates lower to try to to stimulate economic growth."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The summer's sobering trade numbers give new credence to the view that the nation's disturbing trade gap isn't likely to narrow significantly until there's a recession.</br></br>That's not to say a recession is desirable. The heavy debt burdens of U.S. companies and Third World nations, as well as the continued weakness of the banking system, raise fears that a recession now would quickly snowball into financial disaster.</br></br>Nor does a recession appear imminent. At the moment, most indicators point to an economy that is picking up, not sputtering out.</br></br>But the stubborn intransigence of the trade figures, despite Treasury Secretary James Baker's policy to devalue the dollar, suggests no other medicine may be strong enough. The monthly merchandise trade gap set new records in June and July, hitting $15.7 billion and then $16.5 billion. That rise partly reflects seasonal distortions in the statistics; but at best, the trade trend is flat.</br></br>""I've been looking for improvement and haven't seen it, and I'm beginning to get discouraged,"" says Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Charles Kindleberger. ""This may mean we have to have a recession"" before the deficit numbers are reversed."
Positive,"LEADING INDICATORS of the economy fell 0.9% in June. Such a decline could indicate slowing economic growth. New-home sales rose 0.6% to an annual rate of 620,000 units after falling 4.5% in May. June sales were down 5.3% from a year earlier.</br></br>The U.S. dollar soared, setting records against Britain's pound and France's franc. The prospect that the dollar will remain strong indefinitely is pressuring U.S. companies to slash costs, look abroad for parts and materials and move manufacturing facilities overseas.</br></br>---</br></br>ITT said it might divest itself of some businesses soon.

Negative,"In their intensifying search for havens, investors are bidding up Treasury securities and thumbing their noses at just about everything else, from stocks to municipal bonds to government-sponsored enterprises.</br></br>Reacting to fears of a U.S. economic slowdown, investors dumped stocks on Wednesday. Not even low-risk sectors such as utilities or consumer staples were spared. Then in Asia yesterday, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 4.4%, leaving it down 16% this month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which includes a number of China plays, lost an additional 2.3%, bringing its loss for November to 17%.</br></br>The U.S. stock selloff on Wednesday included a 211.10-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the third straight drop. At 12799.04, the Dow is now up 2.7% on the year. It also is nearly 10% off its October highs -- the textbook definition of a ""correction"" that shakes speculative excess out of the market.</br></br>""It's no longer a need for return,"" said Treasury-bond strategist John Spinello at Jefferies & Co. ""It's preserving your capital.""</br></br>Stocks have often bounced after such corrections in the past. For now at least, investors seem to be heading somewhere else instead. The price of a benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained about $2.50 for each $1,000 invested Wednesday. That pushed its yield to 4.024%, its lowest level since September 2005. (Yields fall on bonds as their prices rise.)"
Positive,"The much-anticipated second-half rebound in economic activity shows signs of materializing.</br></br>Some key real-time economic indicators improved during the early weeks of July.</br></br>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that sales in July are tracking at the high end of management's expectations. The company is expecting that stores open at least one year will report a 2% to 4% monthly increase in sales from a year earlier. The company said it is making up for weaker seasonal sales recorded in May and June. The Northeast is especially strong.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private research institute, said its weekly index of leading economic indicators climbed in mid-July to its highest level since early April 2000. The index -- which tracks a range of financial and economic indicators -- is growing at its fastest rate since 1987.</br></br>""The window of [economic] vulnerability that the index picked up earlier in the year has slammed shut,"" said Lakshman Achuthan, the group's managing director."

Negative,"More Liquidity Only Douses Growth Sparks</br></br>Today's ultralow interest rates have helped boost profits, but not economic growth.</br></br>This is plainly evident in recent figures. Since the recession ended in mid-2009, U.S. corporate profits have jumped by about 43% to a record $1.45 trillion as of the first quarter, after taxes, inventory and accounting adjustments, according to the Commerce Department.</br></br>What hasn't recovered, however, is economic growth. Indeed, in real terms, gross domestic product hasn't even returned to its prerecession peak.</br></br>On Friday, Commerce data is likely to show GDP losing further ground. Second-quarter growth, originally reported at a measly 1.3%, is expected to be revised down to 1% in part because exports proved weaker than first thought. That follows GDP growth of just 0.4% in the first quarter, on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis."
Negative,"The U.S. faces an unwelcome combination of looming recession and persistent inflation that is reviving angst about stagflation, a condition not seen since the 1970s.</br></br>Inflation is rising. Yesterday the Labor Department said consumer prices in the U.S. jumped 0.4% in January and are up 4.3% over the past 12 months, near a 16-year high. Even stripping out sharply rising food and energy costs, prices rose 0.3% in January, driven by education, medical care, clothing and hotels. They are up by 2.5% from the previous year, a 10-month high.</br></br>The same day brought a reminder of possible recession. The Federal Reserve disclosed that its policy makers lowered their forecast for economic growth this year to between 1.3% and 2%, half a percentage point below the level of their previous forecast, in October. They blamed a further slowdown on the slump in housing prices, tighter lending standards and higher oil prices. They warned the economy's performance could fall short of even that lowered outlook.</br></br>Stocks fell on the Labor Department's morning inflation report. But shares rallied after the afternoon release of the minutes of the Jan. 29-30 meeting of Fed policy makers and their latest forecast for the economy. That's because investors took the Fed's darker outlook on growth to mean that it intended to cut its short-term interest rate next month at its next scheduled meeting.</br></br>A simultaneous rise in unemployment and inflation poses a dilemma for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. When the Fed wants to fight unemployment, it lowers interest rates. When it wants to damp inflation, it raises them. It's impossible to do both at the same time."
Negative,"WASHINGTON -- There are roughly 600,000 more Americans out of work and looking for jobs than previously believed, the Labor Department said.</br></br>Major changes in the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics tallies the number of jobless workers have given department officials a better handle of how many people are unemployed, and there appears to be several hundred thousand more of them.</br></br>The result is that the high-profile unemployment rate will very likely bump up by half a percentage point when the changes -- which involve asking better-crafted questions and using a computer instead of a pad of paper to record survey answers -- take effect in January. The first employment report under the new system will be issued Feb. 4.</br></br>If a higher unemployment rate is reported as a result of the agency's changes, it wouldn't mean the economy has suddenly gotten worse. It would indicate, however, that the department has been consistently underestimating the number of unemployed people. October's unemployment rate, the latest figure available, rose to 6.8% of the work force, putting the jobless total at about 8.8 million people.</br></br>Such reworking of statistics, though, often confounds policy makers who find they have been making decisions based on one set of assumptions, only to find that a different picture is more accurate."
Positive,"NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average kicked off the second quarter by touching the highest point since the summer of 2008, as investors were heartened by signs of stronger job creation in the U.S. and the lowest jobless rate in two years.</br></br>The Dow industrials rose for a second week in a row and finished Friday with an advance of 56.99 points, or 0.5%, at 12376.72.

Without efforts to reduce federal spending, as have been proposed by congressional Republicans, the deficit would reach $350 billion by 2002, the CBO said.</br></br>The 1995 and 1996 deficits are expected to come in lower than anticipated largely due to factors such as declining interest rates, which the CBO said are expected to be about a full percentage point lower than previously forecast.

Warburg & Co.</br></br>But Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects a loss for the just-ended third quarter. Because of economic uncertainty in Europe, and the overall weakness in the U.S. market, Ford said ""losses could extend into the fourth quarter,"" partially offsetting first-half earnings of $840.3 million. However, Ford said results for the full year should ""represent a substantial improvement over 1991 losses"" of $2.3 billion.</br></br>This week, Allan D. Gilmour, who heads Ford's world-wide automotive operations, said the company remains committed to its aggressive product development programs despite economic weakness in the U.S. and in Europe, where Ford expects a loss for the year.</br></br>""In spite of these weak markets, particularly in Europe, Ford is maintaining its aggressive commitment to invest the resources to bring to market good cars and trucks, and to develop practical, functional technology for these new products,"" Mr. Gilmour said in a speech at the Paris auto show."

Positive,"WASHINGTON--More productive U.S. workers supported faster economic growth in the third quarter, but slower business investment might limit future gains.</br></br>Labor productivity, or output per hours worked, increased at a 1.9% annual rate from July through September, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 2.4%.</br></br>Second-quarter productivity growth was revised down to a 1.8% pace from a previous reading of 2.3%. Productivity held flat from a year ago because the increase in output was matched by an increase in hours worked.</br></br>""Firms cannot count on productivity gains to meet gradually improving demand,"" PNC Chief Economist Stuart Hoffman said. Businesses will need to hire to keep up, ""and the labor market recovery will continue throughout 2014.""</br></br>Productivity improved rapidly in the early part of the recession but gains have eased in recent years. That roughly coincides with business-investment trends. Companies spent more on equipment and technology in 2010 and 2011, investments that helped improve workforce productivity. Such investments began to slow last year and spending on equipment shrank in the third quarter, according to Commerce Department data."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- When the Commerce Department released figures late last year showing a substantial improvement in economic growth during the fourth quarter of 1984, the news was cheered by traders, economic analysts and politicians alike.</br></br>But last week the department released revised figures indicating those cheers were for nought. Instead of growing at an inflation-adjusted 4.3% rate, as previously thought, the new figures showed economic growth was limping in the fourth quarter of 1984 at a meager 0.6% pace.</br></br>That drastic change illustrates how the highly technical ""benchmark"" statistical revisions completed recently by the department have revamped the economic landscape. The department is the sole source of statistics on the nation's total output, or gross national product, and when it alters its numbers, it alters everyone else's view of the world.</br></br>The department's revisions altered virtually all the GNP figures back to 1972, and in some cases reached as far back as 1929. The revisions reflected newly available information, improved estimating techniques and a shift in the price ""base,"" used in adjusting GNP for inflation, to 1982 from 1972.</br></br>For the Reagan administration, the revisions make the economic record look less successful. The revisions show, among other things, that the 1982 recession was more severe than previously thought, and that the expansion that has followed isn't quite as strong as earlier statistics had suggested."

Negative,"DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers, in a mood of caution, are planning to build fewer cars in this year's fourth quarter than in any last quarter since the recession-plagued final period of 1982.</br></br>While a shift toward van and light-truck production accounts for some of the drop in car assembly, the factory schedules nonetheless indicate that the economy's ""soft landing"" hasn't yet erased fears of a slump in Detroit. ""The other side of a soft landing is a soft recovery,"" said Mary Ann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. ""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.</br></br>The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.</br></br>The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.</br></br>Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years."

Exports in August slipped to an adjusted $74.84 billion from $75.10 billion in July; it was the lowest figure since the $73.43 billion in shipments in January 1997.</br></br>Meanwhile, a growing number of countries continue to ship goods here to try to sell their way out of recession. Imports in August climbed to an adjusted $91.61 billion from $89.65 billion the previous month. Exports were weak across the board, reflecting the spreading economic crisis. The U.S. deficit with Japan, which is mired in recession, swelled to $5.2 billion in August from $4.54 billion a year earlier. The year-over-year comparisons provide the most accurate measurement, since these figures aren't seasonally adjusted.</br></br>The overall trade deficit with Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, surged to $15.69 billion from $11.65 billion a year earlier.

Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.</br></br>This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.</br></br>To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.</br></br>Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years.

But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.</br></br>American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.</br></br>Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.</br></br>Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships."" Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester. Technology subsidies to corporations are sold using technobabble to camouflage unjustifiable investments, which typically fall into four categories:"
Negative,"NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence fell sharply in September, the largest monthly decline since just after last October's stock-market crash.</br></br>The Conference Board's confidence index dropped 10.7 points to 109 in September, compared with a revised 119.7 in August. The seasonally adjusted index uses 1985 as a base of 100. The September index was down 6.7 points from the year-earlier level of 115.7. In November 1987, a month after the crash, the index dropped 14.3 points to 100.8.</br></br>""It is still too early to say what may have shaken consumer confidence in September,"" said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. ""Although a single month's reading is inconclusive, the decline in confidence is too large and widespread to be dismissed as merely a technical aberration. The latest economic statistics, showing personal income rising only about half as fast as prices, may well have caused some consumer uneasiness. Still, the present confidence figure remains well above the level that generally signals recession.""</br></br>All sections of the country registered downturns in confidence about the present economic scene as well as expectations about the future situation in the Board's September survey, which is conducted by National Family Opinion Inc., Toledo, Ohio. The Conference Board is an industry-supported, nonprofit economic research group.</br></br>""One of the purposes of the consumer confidence survey is that it gives warning signals,"" Mr. Linden said. ""We're getting warning signals."" The only positive thing about the latest survey, Mr. Linden said was that the index stood above a recession's ""historical trigger level"" of about 80. ""We're still well above a disaster level."""

Positive,"As trading ended at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Friday, scores of traders threw their order cards in the air, like graduates tossing their mortar boards at a high school commencement. And like many graduation exercises, Friday's stock-market session turned out to be less momentous than many had anticipated.</br></br>The final minutes of trading Friday were probably the most intensely scrutinized in the history of the stock and futures exchanges. Federal regulators, exchange officials, investors, newspaper reporters and television crews all wanted to see what market contortions might be produced by the simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures and options and individual stock options.</br></br>This quarterly phenomenon got so much attention because exchange officials and regulators are considering measures to alleviate some of the sharp price swings that sometimes result when arbitrage traders and other investors rush to even out their related positions in stocks and expiring futures and options contracts.</br></br>Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 11 points at 3:59 p.m. EDT; Big Board volume was about 109 million shares.

Positive,"CORPORATE PROFITS surged in the third quarter, reflecting cost-cutting efforts. A Wall Street Journal survey shows that 597 major companies' earnings rose a cumulative 24% from the 1992 period, a sharp acceleration from the 11% gain in the second quarter. But even though some profits were stellar and most exceeded expectations, analysts now worry that companies may have trouble sustaining the recent strong pace of growth.</br></br>Consumer spending rose 0.3% in September even though personal income gained only 0.1%.

Positive,"NEW YORK -- With the U.S. economy continuing to surge ahead, the dollar won't be far behind. It is only how fast it can travel this week that is in question.</br></br>Few disagree the dollar is headed higher against the yen and euro, guided by the U.S. economy's strength relative to Europe and Japan.</br></br>In fact, last Friday's higher-than-expected employment data took a lot of uncertainty out of the market over the need for a tightening of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The figures again underlined the U.S. economy can grow at a strong pace without inflation.</br></br>While lower U.S. rates usually mean a weaker dollar as the yield on dollar-denominated deposits declines, capital flows into the U.S. currency are increasing in line with gains in the U.S. stock market, said Joe Yuska, foreign-exchange manager at Banc One International in Dallas.</br></br>""There is nothing in the horizon that will trip up the dollar,"" said Mr. Yuska, who expects the euro could pass last week's low of $1.0785 to test $1.0680."

The Merrill Lynch strategist, trained in the quantitative arts, sees red flags for stocks every time he cranks up his computer. Valuations are historically high. In May and June, nearly two-thirds of the economic reports he tracks came in below the consensus forecast. Most troubling, inflation barometers are losing momentum, and his calculations hint earnings growth may already have peaked. These findings would shock the smiling bulls.</br></br>""People aren't really looking at the data,"" Mr. Bernstein says.

Negative,"Brace yourself.</br></br>Over the next several weeks, hundreds of U.S. companies will report profit-and-loss statements that are going to look ugly.</br></br>According to analysts' estimates gathered by Thomson Financial/First Call, operating profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 declined 9% in the quarter ended March 31 from the year-earlier period. If the estimates hold up, it will be the sharpest drop since the 1990-91 recession. Second-quarter earnings are also expected to tumble 7% and the third-quarter outlook, while still barely positive, is rapidly deteriorating.</br></br>That's a big departure from 1999 and 2000, when year-over-year quarterly operating profits frequently grew more than 20%. But some economists say the current decline doesn't begin to tell the full story of what's in store in the coming years.</br></br>They say that even once the economy rebounds and earnings start growing again, the outsized profit gains of 1999 and 2000 are a thing of the past. Profits in the 1990s, they say, grew out of sync with the rest of the economy, lifted temporarily by tame debt and labor costs, accounting quirks and technology investments that might never yield significant returns. They say a reversion to the mean is in the works that will translate into a period of profit gains that, at best, are in the single digits. And if consumers cut back on spending in response to their stock market losses, it will only add to the profit pain."

Negative,"Employers were less willing to hire in May and employees were more reluctant to quit, making it more difficult for the unemployed to find work, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.</br></br>There were about 5.7 unemployed workers for every job opening in May, up from about 5.5 a month earlier. As the growing number of job seekers meets the shrinking pool of openings means people are out of work longer, crimping consumer spending and shrinking government budgets.</br></br>""There are huge lines in front of the door of every job opening,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington.</br></br>May data on job openings and labor turnover showed the drop in the rate of job openings at employers has started to flatten out.

Negative,"NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied yesterday amid fresh signs of slower economic growth and an unexpected $2.1 billion drop in the nation's money supply.</br></br>Analysts say these developments increase the chances that the Federal Reserve System will keep its credit policy unchanged. Until recently, many investors had feared that vigorous economic activity and rapid money growth would prompt the Fed to tighten its credit hold and drive up interest rates.</br></br>The Commerce Department yesterday estimated that the economy is growing at only a 2.1% annual rate this quarter, down from a 4.3% clip in last year's fourth quarter. The department's preliminary, or ""flash,"" estimate was well below the rate of about 4% that many analysts had been expecting.</br></br>Prices of some Treasury bonds rose almost 3/4 of a point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates declined. The economic and money-supply figures are ""good news for the bond markets because they mean, at least for the short term, that there is no real threat the Fed is going to be cranking up interest rates,"" said Robert A. Brusca, a vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co.</br></br>Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners, agreed that the figures ""take a little pressure off the Fed"" to tighten credit conditions. But he argued that all they do is ""buy the Fed more time.""

Positive,"CLEVELAND -- Parker Hannifin Corp. expects ""moderate improvement"" in sales and earnings for the year ending next June 30, in spite of a continued recession in Europe, Paul G.

Sales for the quarter rose 6% to $608.2 million from $573.7 million.</br></br>Although business conditions in Europe aren't improving, they don't appear to be growing worse, Mr. Schloemer said. Demand for Parker products appears to have stabilized at a lower level, he said. The company gets about 25% of its sales overseas, mostly in Europe."
Positive,"NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks climbed broadly as better-than-expected data on jobs and manufacturing lifted a broad swath of stocks, including Walt Disney and Alcoa.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 70.44 points, or 0.7%, to 10927.07, the highest close since Sept. 26, 2008. With the stock market closed Friday, the Dow finished the trading week up 0.7%, its fifth consecutive week of advances. That is the Dow's longest weekly winning streak since April 2009.</br></br>The measure was led by some of its most economically sensitive components. Alcoa was the best performer, jumping 46 cents, or 3.2%, to $14.70.

Negative,"The U.S. economy has hit a bump. In the first quarter of 1998 it grew at an annualized rate of 5.4%. The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.</br></br>Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.</br></br>Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.</br></br>The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.</br></br>International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home."

Negative,"Recession talk has cast a pall on the computer industry, but some desktop-computer makers are still shining.</br></br>Analysts say results for the December quarter will illustrate a continued split of the industry, in which many makers of mainframes and minicomputers post smaller gains while makers of personal computers and workstations prosper.</br></br>Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass. -- once a highflier that used its minicomputers to tweak the noses of oldline makers of more expensive mainframes -- is getting some nose-tweaking of its own by the likes of Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. with less expensive, fast workstations. Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.</br></br>A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard software such as programs written for Unix operating systems. That hurts makers of proprietary systems -- those that run software written only for them.</br></br>But it's a boon for Sun and large PC makers such as Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which, despite recession signs, continue to post strong gains. Analyst Bruce Lupatkin of Hambrecht & Quist Inc. expects Compaq to post a 70% rise in fourth-quarter earnings to $133 million, or $1.55 a share, from the year-earlier $79 million, or 92 cents a share, on a 40% revenue gain to $1.1 billion from $788 million."
Negative,"The dollar fell 1.1% against the Japanese yen and posted smaller declines against major European currencies in activity dominated by cross-trading and technical moves.</br></br>The U.S. currency also was undercut by interest-rate increases in West Germany and rumors of a rise in the Japanese central bank's key rate. After major U.S. banks raised their prime lending rates half a point to 9 1/4% yesterday, speculation also heated up about a discount-rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board.</br></br>Rate increases overseas would tend to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive and decrease demand for the U.S. currency. Although the boost in U.S. prime rates provided some support for the dollar, traders expressed fears that higher U.S. rates will only constrain an already troubled economy and fail to help the currency.</br></br>""If the economy isn't doing well and the interest rate goes up, that is only going to hurt the economy more,"" Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said.</br></br>In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 145.20 yen, compared with 146.78 late Tuesday.

Positive,"WASHINGTON -- With signs that the job market is softening only a bit, consumer confidence remains high heading into the holiday shopping season, giving beleaguered retailers a reason to cheer.</br></br>The Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed by an unexpectedly large 7,000 last week while a longer-term gauge hit its highest level in nearly two years. The numbers suggest that the jobless rate will increase in coming months.</br></br>Still, the unemployment picture has yet to take a bite out of consumer's confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment actually increased in November, surprising analysts expecting a decline due to stock-market weakness and continuing election uncertainty. The index finished the month at 107.6, nearly two points higher than its 105.8 level in October and only a few points below the record set in January.</br></br>The report offered a burst of good news for the nation's retailers, who have seen their stock prices battered in recent weeks amid evidence of slackening sales and dire predictions for a relatively weak holiday-shopping season. Most retailers' fortunes rest on the crowds of shoppers who flock to their stores between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.</br></br>The new data suggest that such fears may be groundless. ""With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect robust growth in consumer spending,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y."
Negative,"The U.S. economy might not be getting back on its feet quite as quickly as some investors have come to believe.</br></br>The unemployment rate jumped to 5.7% in November, its highest level in more than six years, the Labor Department said Friday.

Negative,"The failure of the White House to promote an aggressive economic recovery plan may severely imperil GOP chances of holding on to the House and taking back control of the Senate in 2002. As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.</br></br>Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.</br></br>This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.</br></br>We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.</br></br>Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums. True, many Wall Street economists are also predicting a resumption of growth soon, but they have been totally wrong in predicting the direction of the economy and stock market over the past several years, so their confidence is actually discouraging."

Although the decline wasn't as steep as some had expected, other statistics in the report clearly suggested that the labor market is weaker than many economists anticipated.</br></br>For example, job losses in the manufacturing sector were enormous; jobs fell 95,000 in April. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts. Many economists say hiring will pick up only after there is an uptick in hours worked, since companies generally try to make their existing employees work longer before they hire additional people.</br></br>In Washington, President Bush used the jump in the unemployment rate to spur members of Congress to pass a ""robust"" tax-cut package to stimulate the economy. Speaking to defense workers in California, the president took the issue of the rising jobless rate, a potential political liability, and turned it to his advantage. The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""</br></br>Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%."
Negative,"In normal times, the best advice after a market decline is ""Don't be afraid."" But these are not normal times, and anyone who is not afraid after a 50% market decline has a few screws loose. The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.</br></br>Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.</br></br>For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic. Call it ""smart panic"" -- calculated actions that free you from the chains of inertia without compelling you to go haywire.</br></br>Normally, inertia keeps investors locked into all their investments, good and bad. As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. Severe losses can shock any investor out of inertia, often in destructive ways.</br></br>Here is a list of constructive steps you can take instead:"

Negative,"NEW YORK -- A falling dollar and increasing nervousness about how much Japanese investors will buy in this week's Treasury refunding pushed bond prices lower in light trading.</br></br>Prices of some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds fell almost 1 1/4 points, or nearly $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, after falling about 1 1/2 points Friday. The two-day loss erased all the gains made last Thursday when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker confirmed that the Fed was pushing up short-term interest rates to help stabilize the dollar.</br></br>Traders said the bond market was rife with rumors about how active Japanese investors would be in the government's quarterly refunding operation, which begins today. As the dollar continued to fall against the yen yesterday, some analysts speculated about whether Japanese investors would participate in the refunding auctions at all.</br></br>""There's no reason for anyone, American or Japanese, to buy bonds right now,"" said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. ""Economic activity is picking up, the inflation rate is rising, and there's no clear evidence that the U.S. is prepared to defend the dollar at its current level. For a foreign investor, there's a currency risk as well as an inflation risk in buying bonds.""</br></br>But another analyst, who requested anonymity, said he believes Japanese will be buyers in the refunding. ""It makes a lot of sense for them to be in it, and it also makes sense for them to pooh-pooh it beforehand,"" he said. ""It's to their advantage to do the most surprising thing. So if the market has been beat up, and everyone's pessimistic, then they collectively have enough size to buy a lot of bonds, cause a short-covering rally and make some nice profits."""
Negative,"Author: Peter D. Schiff</br></br>Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</br></br>Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</br></br>Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</br></br>By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit."
Negative,"Author: Michael Casey</br></br>NEW YORK--Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke left investors disappointed after he painted a gloomy picture of the U.S. economy but gave no indication the Fed is preparing any new stimulus measures.</br></br>Stocks and other assets with greater exposure to risk fell, while U.S. Treasurys and the dollar gained as Mr. Bernanke delivered his much-awaited semiannual address to Congress, describing the economic outlook as ""unusually uncertain.""</br></br>The Fed chairman reiterated the Fed's official view that interest rates would stay near zero for ""an extended period."" But although he stressed that it is ""prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our nation's productive potential,"" he offered no new policy options for reversing the recent slowdown in the U.S. economic recovery.</br></br>In answer to senators' questions, Mr. Bernanke later explored the possibility of further stimulus measures ""if the recovery seems to be faltering,"" but in failing to address this in his prepared remarks he left investors disappointed. In the lead-up to his appearance, there had been growing speculation that the Fed chairman might signal the central bank's willingness to cease paying interest on the reserves it holds on banks' behalf, a move that would be an incentive for banks to lend that money to customers. Indeed, Mr. Bernanke mentioned that idea, along with other prospects for added stimulus in the question-and-answer session, although he said that for now the Fed was still intent on gauging the strength of the recovery."
Negative,"NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled because of soaring oil prices and the growing expectation among investors that analysts are about to unleash a torrent of reduced corporate-earnings estimates.</br></br>The October futures contract for crude oil advanced $1.66 a barrel to close at $31.43.

The consensus expectation is that the unemployment rate will be unchanged from July's 5.5%.</br></br>The dollar continued to slump against most other major currencies. The yen continued to rise on speculation that Japanese interest rates are likely to increase while those in the U.S. decline.</br></br>Although rising oil prices didn't help, it was reports of analysts readying earnings-estimate cuts that sent shivers through the stock market.

Negative,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy's current weakness may not respond to the Federal Reserve's conventional medicine of rapidly cutting the short-term interest rates it controls, Fed Gov.

Since April of 1989, that's been my game plan.""</br></br>Because so many of the economy's ills reflect a real estate bust, the Fed instead needs to bring down long-term interest rates, Mr. Angell said in an interview. Those rates are set largely in financial markets -- and reflect expectations of inflation as well as the credibility of the Fed's anti-inflation commitment.</br></br>Mr. Angell insisted that he wasn't revealing how he voted at the last meeting of Fed policy makers or how he intended to vote when they meet in two weeks, but his analysis suggests a go-slow approach.</br></br>The Fed is under pressure to cut short-term rates further in response to what is now widely regarded as a recession. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is believed to have been given leeway to reduce rates before the Fed's policy committee convenes again in about two weeks. But internal objections could dissuade him from doing so."

Negative,"The last recession seriously eroded equal opportunity for America's black workers.</br></br>Blacks were the only racial group to suffer a net job loss during the 1990-91 economic downturn, at the companies reporting to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Whites, Hispanics and Asians, meanwhile, gained thousands of jobs, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of EEOC records.</br></br>The computer-aided study shows that some of the nation's largest corporations shed black employees at the most disproportionate rate. At Dial Corp., for instance, blacks lost 43.6% of the jobs cut, even though they represented 26.3% of Dial's work force going into the recession. At W.R. Grace & Co., they held 32.2% of the jobs cut, while they accounted for 13.1% of the company's pre-recession payroll. At BankAmerica Corp. and ITT Corp., blacks lost jobs at more than twice the rate of their companies' overall work-force reductions.</br></br>Companies say the sudden demographic shift is a statistical fluke, the unintentional fallout of corporate cutbacks and reorganizations.

Negative,"WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes fell 8.1% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000, the lowest pace in a year. Analysts predicted they could drop further in coming months.</br></br>The August decline followed a revised 2.2% decrease in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000, the Commerce Department reported. The department originally had said sales of new single-family homes were unchanged in July.</br></br>The decrease is ""in line with expectations for what I think is a moderate decline in construction and new and existing home sales,"" said Mark Riedy, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. ""I think we're near the bottom of the decline.""</br></br>While Mr. Riedy and several other economists expect new-home sales to drop modestly through year-end, they disagree about next year's outlook because of uncertainty about the mortgage interest-rate picture. New-home sales should total about 665,000 for all 1984, up from 623,000 last year, Mr. Riedy forecast, saying that next year they ""may be a little higher"" or the same.</br></br>Future new home-sales activity depends on interest rates, and ""I don't see much promise of them falling enough"" to spark a resurgence of demand, said James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Similarly, Michael Carliner, a senior economist at Chase Econometrics, sees new-home sales dropping to a rate of 590,000 next year from his projected 625,000-unit rate this year, saying there will be ""a small surge"" in mortgage rates in 1985."
Positive,"WASHINGTON--Sales of new homes surged in June despite higher mortgage rates, maintaining momentum for a key sector driving the economic recovery.</br></br>New-home sales increased 8.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 497,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the highest level since May 2008. Sales were up 38% from a year earlier.</br></br>The sales jump comes amid a sharp escalation in mortgage rates, which began rising in late May. The average for a 30-year fixed-rate loan is now up about one percentage point from its recent low to 4.58%, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data also released Wednesday. That's down from 4.68% a week earlier.</br></br>""The increase in mortgage rates over the past two months does not appear to have dented new-home sales, at least not yet,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. He cited pent-up demand, a better labor market and stronger consumer confidence as factors behind the sales boost.</br></br>Mortgage rates can hit new-home sales more quickly than sales of previously owned homes because the new-home figures are measured when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a new home. Existing-home sales figures reflect closings 30 to 60 days later, on average, after a contract is signed."

Positive,"NEW YORK -- Small was beautiful in August as microcap stock funds picked up steam and posted the best returns among domestic equity funds.</br></br>However, investors may not want to build their hopes too high for microcap funds, which typically invest in companies with market capitalizations of less than $300 million. Observers say the sector's gains weren't so much the result of increased buying of microcap stocks, but rather a lack of selling as the rest of the stock market headed lower.</br></br>According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., microcap funds provided investors with a 5.54% return in August. And while that was the smallest monthly gain for the group since April, it topped all other categories of equity funds during August. The closest sector was small-cap funds, which posted a 1.83% gain for the month.</br></br>Funds that had been the big winners all year -- funds tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- were the big losers among domestic stock funds in August, dropping 5.59%.</br></br>Over the past 13 weeks, microcap stocks are well ahead of all other domestic equity funds, with a nearly 19% gain since June 6.

Negative,"WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in two years as the holiday season failed to lift the spirit of Americans rattled by stock-market volatility and mounting fears of a significant economic slowdown.</br></br>The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop.</br></br>The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth.</br></br>Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity; shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.</br></br>That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as ""somewhat disconcerting."""
Negative,"Author: Brad Schiller</br></br>The latest employment reports have not been encouraging. At the rate of 36,000 new jobs a month--the number gained in January--we will never get back to full employment. Even if we keep adding jobs at the December rate of 121,000 new jobs, we wouldn't achieve full employment in this millennium.</br></br>President Obama has urged us to be ""patient"" with this jobless recovery. But it's worth asking how long it will take to get back to the employment levels we experienced before the recession of 2008-09. How patient will we need to be?</br></br>Consider the math of full employment. We now have a labor force of 153 million people, of whom 14 million are officially counted as ""unemployed,"" defined as not working and actively seeking a job. Were we fully employed (defined as 5% unemployment) there would be 7.7 million unemployed workers.

But all this has not softened the pessimism of many pundits and politicians who are either unimpressed or expect the whole thing to come crashing down any minute. That is, unless the government firmly grabs the reins of the global economy and steers it clear of disaster.</br></br>Many believe that the debate is over on global warming, nationalized health care, tax hikes, rich-versus-poor, the trade deficit and ""obscene"" oil company profits. Forgotten in this rush to pass judgment on capitalism is the fact that the last two times government seriously tried to control the U.S. economy -- in the 1930s and in the 1970s -- they made a terrible mess of it.</br></br>In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act caused a collapse in global trade, while the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by one- third. Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.</br></br>It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again. Between 1965 and 1981, Great Society welfare and health-care programs, wage and price controls, inflationary Fed policy, 70% marginal tax rates, 50% capital-gains tax rates, and highly regulated energy, airline, banking and trucking industries created severe problems.

Negative,"WASHINGTON -- Retail sales tumbled in March as job losses and tight credit left consumers cautious and constrained, damping hopes for a rapid economic turnaround.</br></br>After some improvement earlier this year from a dismal autumn, retail sales in March fell 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Credit turmoil continued to hit automobile sales especially hard, but the declines also came in most major categories, from appliances to furniture to clothing stores. Retail sales, a broad tally that also includes food services, were down more than 9% from the same month a year ago.</br></br>The decline signaled that consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, probably won't bounce back quickly from the depths of the recession. Consumers, hit by a weak job market and steep declines in household wealth, remain worried that more tough times lie ahead.</br></br>The retail-sales report comes after weeks of hope that the recession was nearing its low point. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a speech Tuesday at Morehouse College in Atlanta, cited recent data on home sales, home building and consumer spending, including sales of new vehicles, as ""tentative signs that the sharp decline in economic activity may be slowing."" But the central-bank chief warned that ""we will not have a sustainable recovery without a stabilization of our financial system and credit markets.""</br></br>The economy continues to deteriorate at a rapid pace.

Negative,"NEW YORK -- Consumers, who made their presence felt in last week's retail sales report, find out tomorrow how inflated the bill was when the November consumer price index is released.</br></br>The CPI, which measures inflation, is expected to have risen 0.4%, about the same as in October. Economists' estimates for November's increase run from 0.2% to 0.5%, according to MMS International, a Redwood City, Calif., firm. Retail sales jumped 1.1% in November, raising concerns that inflation is creeping up to troublesome levels.</br></br>Even if the CPI comes in flat, some economists think it's only a matter of time before prices leap. ""The economy is like a sleeping tiger waiting to be awakened by a very strong economy,"" said Allen Sinai, president of Boston Co.'s Economic Advisors Inc. unit. ""And the fourth quarter looks extremely strong,"" he added.</br></br>The overall CPI index has been climbing by 0.3% or 0.4% each month during the past half year, for an annual rate increase of 4.6%. Mr. Sinai figures that the annual rate could speed up to 5.5% to 6% in the not-too-distant future.</br></br>Food and energy, the CPI's two most volatile components, have been relatively stable recently. But economists say that food price increases seem moderate largely because the drought-induced runup last summer is abating. And oil prices aren't fully reflecting recent increases in crude oil quotations, they added."

As with many auto suppliers, Dana is struggling with higher raw-material costs and exposure to the decline in U.S. market share by Detroit's big auto makers, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.

Negative,"The Iowa caucuses presented the full range of views of the Republican hopefuls. When it came to fiscal strategy, however, there was almost no daylight among them. Each candidate decried the rise of government spending and wants to cut taxes.</br></br>Again and again they noted that spending under President Obama rose to 25% of the economy in 2009, the highest in decades and well over the 20%-21% norm of the last 30 years.</br></br>To hear the GOP candidates tell it, this fact explains the deficit, explains America's long-run fiscal problem, and explains why new taxes cannot be tolerated. Congressional Republicans have the same outlook. The deficit is up thanks to government spending, so we must cut spending right now in every form.</br></br>Yet the long-run fiscal problem facing the country--which is real--has almost nothing to do with the reasons that the deficit is currently large or that spending is abnormally high. They are high for the same reason taxes are abnormally low: because of the economic downturn. We should debate the real issues, not try to pretend the recession never happened.</br></br>The Congressional Budget Office forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit before the Obama administration even came into office. The stimulus added only around $250 billion a year, and more than one-third of that came from tax cuts, especially the tax credit in the stimulus bill's ""Making Work Pay"" provision."
Positive,"AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>The Fed chairman also said for the first time that the explosive rise in employment last month doesn't mean the economy is growing too fast. ""It is possible that the February data may have exaggerated the strength of the labor market to some extent,"" Mr. Greenspan said. ""We've not seen a similar degree of strength in other labor-market indicators,"" such as initial claims for unemployment insurance. The March 8 jobs report jolted the markets, as investors lost hopes for further interest rate cuts and some worried that the Fed might even raise rates.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan said that while some uncertainties remain, ""recent data have confirmed the expectation that a good bit of the economic sluggishness of late 1995 was related to inventory adjustment,"" as companies struggled to pare stockpiles of unsold goods. ""The current economic expansion seems to have exhibited staying power,"" despite the drag from January's severe weather, the brief government shutdown and the recent General Motors Corp. strike, he said.</br></br>He also said high consumer-debt levels and other factors still might be restraining spending. But ""the recent data seem to indicate that those restraining influences are not so strong as to seriously jeopardize the continued expansion of the economy,"" Mr. Greenspan said.</br></br>Economic growth, he said, should continue without fueling inflation. The latest reports of continued low inflation, he said, are ""reasonably encouraging,"" pronouncing himself pleased but ""never satisfied."""
Negative,"Data released this week by the Commerce Department waved bright red recession flags--orders for durable goods fell 13.2% in August and inflation-adjusted personal income fell 0.3%. President Obama is asking for more time to allow the lackluster recovery to pick up steam. His plan is to move the economy ""forward"" by keeping the current policy framework in place and adding higher tax rates on income and capital gains. But the new Commerce Department numbers, combined with his stay-the-course approach, point to recession in 2013.</br></br>This administration's economic policy is built on deficit spending, government control over the economy and dependence on the Federal Reserve to buy the government's excess debt. These policies aren't working. They discourage private investment and jobs, and the policies have resulted in high unemployment, weak business confidence and rapidly declining median incomes.</br></br>The signature of our times is the fever for investing in government bonds and $1,700-an-ounce gold rather than in job creation and small businesses. That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.</br></br>These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.</br></br>The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government."
Positive,"Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.</br></br>In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.</br></br>Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.</br></br>Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.</br></br>This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France."
Positive,"CHICAGO -- Plenty of Americans know that Japanese investors have gobbled up Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and New York's Rockefeller Center. But with less fanfare, the Japanese are also pouring money into trading in the booming U.S. financial futures markets.</br></br>It was only three years ago that Japanese securities firms began buying seats on Chicago's Board of Trade and Mercantile Exchange, the two biggest U.S. futures markets. Since then, Japanese trading here has increased sharply.</br></br>The Japanese may already account for as much as 40% of the volume in the bustling Eurodollar pit at the Chicago Merc, where financial futures based on the fluctuation of short-term interest rates are traded. Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Merc's executive committee, has predicted that by 1992 a third of the Merc's total volume will come from the Japanese.</br></br>Yet while financial markets in Japan at times are given to speculation, Japanese tastes here tend toward futures based on bonds and interest rates, contracts frequently used to hedge the risk of relatively conservative fixed-income investments like U.S. Treasury bonds.</br></br>""Certainly, Japanese investors have invested heavily in U.S. Treasury bonds and related futures, but not much in U.S. equities or the corresponding futures,"" said Nobuaki Ohmura, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., a unit of one of the ""Big Four"" Japanese securities firms."
Negative,"It usually doesn't happen this quickly in Washington. But President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are finding that the old maxim that what goes around, comes around applies to them, too. Less than six months into his term, Mr. Obama's top initiatives -- health-care reform and ""cap and trade"" energy legislation -- are in serious jeopardy and he has himself and his congressional allies to blame.</br></br>Their high-pressure tactics in promoting and passing legislation, most notably the economic ""stimulus"" enacted in February, have backfired. Those tactics include unbridled partisanship, procedural short cuts, demands for swift passage of bills, and promises of quick results.</br></br>With large majorities in Congress and an obsequious press corps, Mr. Obama was smitten with the idea of emulating President Franklin Roosevelt's First 100 Days of legislative success in 1933. Like FDR, Mr. Obama tried to push as many liberal bills through Congress in as brief a time as possible.</br></br>He made a rookie mistake early on. He let congressional Democrats draft the bills. They're as partisan as any group that has ever controlled Congress, and as impatient. They have little interest in the compromises needed to attract Republican support. As a consequence, what they passed -- especially the $787 billion stimulus -- belongs to Democrats alone. They own the stimulus outright.</br></br>That makes them accountable for the hopes of a prompt economic recovery now being dashed. With the economy still faltering and jobs still being lost, Mr. Obama's credibility is sinking and his job approval rating is declining along with the popularity of his initiatives. Republicans, who had insisted the stimulus was wasteful and wouldn't work, are being vindicated."

Negative,"WASHINGTON -- Retail sales fell 0.9% last month, as automobile purchases skidded, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>Aside from auto dealers, however, most other retailers -- including department stores, clothing stores and building-supply dealers -- reported healthy gains in sales. And the department made a large upward revision to its calculation of January retail sales, to a 2.8% increase from its original estimate of 1.6%</br></br>January's rise, just as February's decline, was influenced heavily by car buying. In January, car sales rocketed 9.9%, according to the department; in February, they plunged 6%. Looking beyond the erratic auto figures, most economists said the retail numbers indicate consumer spending is sound enough to keep the economy growing.</br></br>""There is enough life in these numbers to suggest that consumer spending isn't deteriorating further,"" said George Iwanicki, an economist at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York. However, Mr. Iwanicki said the report ""doesn't answer the question of whether the demand side of the economy is really rebounding.""</br></br>The economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of 1989, hurt partly by the California earthquake, a strike at Boeing Co. and a severe slowdown in consumer spending.

Negative,"Author: Mark Whitehouse</br></br>U.S. households saw their wealth decline in the second quarter despite their efforts to save more money, underscoring the economy's struggle to recover from the recession.</br></br>The Federal Reserve reported Friday that household net worth--stocks, bonds, homes and other assets, minus mortgages and other debts--fell 2.8% to $53.5 trillion in the second quarter, driven by a sharp decline in the value of stock investments. The drop, the first since the darkest days of the financial crisis in early 2009, left average net worth at about $182,000 a person--though the average is pulled up by a small group of the very wealthy.</br></br>The numbers highlight the extent to which erratic financial markets are adding to the job troubles already weighing on consumers. While markets have rebounded somewhat in recent weeks, many people are keeping a lid on spending and focusing on repairing damaged nest eggs.</br></br>""I worry every day about our financial future,"" said Steve Gohmann, a 62-year-old retired insurance industry executive. He said that he and his wife were cutting their discretionary spending by some 18% this year while they try to rebuild their investments, which are down about 13% from their peak in 2007. Among the cuts: Golf outings and membership in a California wine club."
Negative,"The dollar is headed down this year and will set new lows against the yen and possibly the mark as well.</br></br>That's the view of many savants in the foreign exchange market. They say it's only a question of whether the drop begins soon or the decline holds off until the second half.</br></br>They believe that lackluster U.S. trade results and, eventually, a slowing economy and receding U.S. interest rates will reduce the dollar's allure to traders and international investors. A lack of progress in reducing the U.S. budget deficit also could diminish foreigners' confidence in the U.S. and its currency.</br></br>Last year, the dollar surprised many analysts. Expectations at the start of the year were that the U.S. currency would fall sharply, continuing a decline that began in late February 1985. Many people assumed that after the October 1987 stock market crash, dollar stability wouldn't be an important policy goal and that the currency would have to keep falling to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit.</br></br>The dollar did tumble to 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks in intraday trading Jan. 4, 1988 -- its lowest levels since the modern exchange-rate system was established in the late 1940s."
Negative,"California's fiscal woes aren't over yet. Only months after state lawmakers in February had to raise taxes and slash spending to close a $42 billion budget deficit, legislators in May will begin work on filling a new multibillion-dollar shortfall.</br></br>A state agency projects an additional $8 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that ends in July 2010, a result of declining tax revenue amid the recession. The figure could grow if revenue plummets further.</br></br>And it could get worse yet if voters defeat a series of ballot measures on May 19 aimed at closing the earlier deficit. That is a possibility, as a March 25 poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California shows 50% of Californians against Proposition 1C, which would allow the state to borrow $5 billion against future lottery revenue, versus 37% who support it.</br></br>The proposition's backers, who include Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders, said they expect increased support for the measures as they begin campaigning. ""As they step back and we get information to them, they'll say, 'You know what, this makes sense,'"" said Republican Mike Villines, the Assembly's minority leader.</br></br>About $2 billion of the new deficit can be wiped out by using cash reserves that were built into the plan approved in February. Legislators are waiting until May 28, when the governor is scheduled to release his revised budget, to get into specifics on how they will close the rest of the gap."
Negative,"Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has now staked out his and his party's economic policies, and -- in tune with the styles of today -- they're retro. The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse.</br></br>To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits ""as far as the eye could see"" thereafter.</br></br>Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election.</br></br>Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point: It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, ""stayed the course.""</br></br>Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined. The nation shook off the strange combination of slow growth and inflation that characterized the Carter years and grew at a healthy rate through the rest of the 1980s. The stock market, recognizing that a new and different economic policy had taken hold in Washington, surged to unprecedented levels."

Nor do those figures explain the mysteries of an economy that has been struggling to gain enough velocity to shake off its many ailments long after the recession ended.</br></br>Consumer spending remains weak, a consequence of a labor market delivering new jobs but skimpy wage growth.

Positive,"NEW YORK -- The dollar leapt higher Wednesday -- particularly against European currencies -- propelled by President Clinton's call for the Deutsche Bundesbank to lower German interest rates.</br></br>The remarks had extra impact because the foreign exchange market is bullish on the U.S. currency and was experiencing end-of-the-month thinness, traders said.</br></br>Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.7035 marks, up from 1.6885 marks late Tuesday in New York.

Negative,"The past two months have been punishing ones for investors in ""high yield,"" or junk-bond, funds.</br></br>After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain.</br></br>The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds.

Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market.</br></br>But ""too often,"" Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- ""just another bond fund with a higher yield."" In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground.</br></br>That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0% return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7% decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index.

Positive,"What with the low bar that analysts typically set for them, it shouldn't be a shocker that companies' first-quarter earnings are clearing estimates. But the margin that they're clearing them by is pretty impressive.</br></br>With results from about 271 of companies in the index already in, first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now on track for a gain of 3.6% versus a year ago, according to S&P Capital IQ. That isn't very strong, but it is much better than the 0.5% that analysts were looking for at the start of this month. And given that about half the companies in the index have yet to report, and that they, too, will likely top estimates, actual earnings growth will likely be higher still.</br></br>Sales-growth figures, on the other hand, have been going the other way. As of Friday, S&P 500 revenue was on track for a gain of 1.4% versus a year ago. At the beginning of the month, that gain was pegged at 4%. Another sign of the divide between what's happening to the top and bottom lines: Only 43% of companies have topped revenue estimates thus far, compared with 70% for earnings.</br></br>The decline in revenue-growth expectations isn't as bad as it seems at first blush, however. Much of it is concentrated in the energy and basic materials sectors, and reflects a decline in commodity prices that is helping drive down costs to other companies, as well as consumers.</br></br>And once again, the overall weakness in revenue seems concentrated in companies' foreign, rather than domestic, operations. Some evidence for that: Friday's gross domestic product report for the U.S. showed that final sales to domestic purchasers were up 3% in the first quarter. Since large public companies, if anything, tend to generate better sales growth than the overall economy is experiencing, it is pretty clear that overseas sales are the real weak spot."
Negative,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The gap between the nation's richest and poorest cities widened in 1987 as the posh Connecticut suburbs of New York stayed atop the per capita personal income list while Texas towns along the Mexican border remained last, the government reported yesterday.</br></br>In a report on 1987 personal income in the nation's 318 metropolitan regions, first place belonged to the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury area of Connecticut, with per capita income of $26,316, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>Bringing up the rear was the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of Texas, with per capita income of $7,001.</br></br>The first and last areas were the same as in 1986, but the gap between them grew as the 9.1% rate of per capita income growth in the Bridgeport area more than doubled the 4.2% pace in the McAllen region.

Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed sharply to $10.4 billion in February from $12.67 billion a month earlier, as soaring civilian-aircraft sales propelled exports to a record level.</br></br>The figures reflected a healthy U.S. economy. But analysts expect the gap to widen in the months ahead, with export sales slowing. February exports rose to a record $73.46 billion from $70.65 billion a month earlier. Imports rose more slowly, to less than $84 billion from $83.31 billion in January.</br></br>Early yesterday, the Commerce Department reported the February deficit at $11.59 billion but changed its numbers in the evening after rechecking the figures. It said that ""data-reporting errors at several ports of entry"" caused a $1.1 billion overcount when tallying crude-oil imports for the month. After seasonal adjustments, it added, the February deficit was recalculated at $10.4 billion.</br></br>The department said a complete revision of the figures will be released today.</br></br>Even the relatively small rise in imports prompted many economists to scale back their optimistic estimates of gross-domestic-product growth for the first quarter. Surprisingly strong reports on consumer spending and industrial production had led to ""a consensus number for the first quarter of 4.5% growth,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis, well above the strong 3.8% growth in the fourth quarter. The trade numbers, he said ""could knock anywhere from 0.75 to 1.25 percentage points off first-quarter GDP estimates."""
Positive,"The U.S. dollar should remain strong this week, barring a major intervention by the West German central bank, analysts said.</br></br>Despite declining interest rates, which normally make the dollar less attractive, and indicators that point to a weakening U.S. economy, the dollar rose last week against major foreign currencies. Traders ignored the Federal Reserve Board's 0.5 percentage point cut, to 8.5%, Wednesday in its discount rate, the widely watched charge for loans to financial institutions. ""The divergence between the foreign-exchange and credit markets continues,"" said Leslie Puth, assistant secretary at Irving Trust Co.</br></br>""The credit markets have been trading on immediate news, while currency markets are focusing on the federal budget deficit and its future implications,"" Ms. Puth said.

Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its key short-term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%, saying the U.S. economy ""appears to have regained some traction"" after ""moderating earlier this year.""</br></br>The Fed said nothing to dissuade financial markets from anticipating another quarter-point rate increase before year end.</br></br>The Fed's campaign to lift interest rates is intended not to slow the economy, but to raise rates from emergency lows in order to avoid creating an inflation problem in the future. The target on the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, was chopped to a 45-year-low of 1% in mid-2003 from 6.5% at the start of 200. With much advance warning, the Fed began lifting rates in June.</br></br>The economy now appears to have pulled out of a ""soft patch"" -- as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has put it -- that was largely the result of higher oil prices.

Following disappointing second-quarter growth of 2.8%, the U.S. economy now is expanding at better than 3.5%, perhaps as strong as 4%, private economists estimate.</br></br>But recent declines in long-term bond yields suggest the bond market may not be as optimistic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.05% yesterday, well below June's 4.87%; yields fall as bond prices rise. Stocks rallied.

Business executives appear dangerously euphoric and, at least until last week, so did stock-market investors. What more will it take for Alan Greenspan to pull the interest-rate trigger?</br></br>A lot, apparently.</br></br>There is little doubt Federal Reserve officials would fall in line if Mr. Greenspan opened their Nov. 12 meeting by calling for higher rates, a step he hasn't taken since March. The published summary of the Fed's August meeting, the most recent available, is full of fretting about ""the risks of rising inflation.""</br></br>Other Fed officials caution that when things look too good to be true, they probably are. ""The economy's performance over the last year or so-the extraordinary combination of above-trend growth, exceptionally tight labor markets, but continued low inflation-has been much more favorable than I and many others expected,"" Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said the other day.

Positive,"WASHINGTON -- Retail sales jumped a surprising 1.4% in February, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>The big increase suggests consumer spending continues to be strong in spite of signs of weakness among the nation's manufacturing industries.

A strong dollar makes imports less expensive and makes U.S. exports less competitive on world markets.</br></br>""Until recently, the demand side has been sufficiently vigorous that it has provided growth for everybody,"" Mr. Yardeni said.

""I am concerned about inflation down the road,"" he explains. ""The time is right for us to bring clarity to the Fed."" In the House, Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Michael Pence (R., Ind.) agree. Mr. Pence argues that the Fed's quest to combat unemployment by buying $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys is a failure and threatens to ""monetize our debt and trigger inflation.""</br></br>The implication is that the Fed has lost its moorings. Has it really? For more than 30 years, Congress has charged the Fed with aiming at ""maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."" That wording has long made some Fed officials and academic economists uneasy because it is rooted in a now-abandoned view that the government could dial up a little more inflation to get a little less unemployment and vice versa.</br></br>The current consensus is that the Fed can -- and, indeed, is now attempting to -- reduce unemployment in a recession, but in the long run can deliver only price stability. What Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke calls ""the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate"" is determined by demographics, job-market rules and other factors beyond the Fed's control. In this view, if the Fed tried to push unemployment too low now, it could create too much inflation later, the mistake the Fed made in the late 1970s.</br></br>But it is not the 1970s. Even though the Fed has been holding short-term interest rates near zero for nearly two years, prices rose at only a 1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. No measure of inflation expectations foresees anything like the 8%-plus inflation of the '70s. And it's hard to find a single Greenspan or Bernanke decision that would have been different if they had an inflation-only mandate. So why all this now?"
Positive,"Copper futures prices were firm again on indications of an improved economy and prospective demand for the metal.</br></br>May delivery copper rose 2.75 cents a pound to $1.06, for a two-day gain of 5.5 cents.

""You have the more than 20% increase in new home sales in February and the housing market is a key user of copper.""</br></br>William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures, New York, observed that while trading lacked distinction, the premium commanded by the May futures contract over more distant months was a key indicator of the strength in the market.</br></br>""One spread that traders are closely watching is the May-December,"" he said. The premium of May over December rose 0.75 cent a pound to 15.8 cents, he said, which indicates ""concern during forthcoming months about supplies of copper to meet demand."""

Negative,"President Obama, in speech after speech, proudly makes the following point: Although we inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, we have generated net new jobs every month, and while we need to do more, we are going in the right direction.</br></br>Of course, recoveries always go in the right direction--that is, things get better over time. But merely going in the right direction is an incredibly low performance standard. Moreover, since deep recessions are generally followed by more robust recoveries, this should have been one of the strongest recoveries ever.</br></br>So what went wrong? All the available Keynesian levers for achieving economic growth have been pulled, yet the recovery is one of the weakest since World War II. The problem lies with the way the ""stimulus"" was carried out, the uncertainty of looming higher taxes, and the antibusiness rhetoric and regulatory strong-arming of this administration.</br></br>First, exactly how weak has this recovery been? The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis tracks economic performance for each recovery and compares gross-domestic-product growth and job growth, the two most important indicators of economic performance. Over the past 60 years, there have been 11 recessions and 11 recoveries.</br></br>Sadly, this recovery is near the bottom of all 11. Cumulative nonfarm job growth is just 1.9% 34 months into recovery, the ninth-worst performance and well below the average job growth of 6.5%. Cumulative GDP growth is just 6.8% 11 quarters into this recovery, less than half the average (15.2%) and the worst of all 11."

Positive,"WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's economic advisers say the trend in U.S. productivity growth may be improving, boosting the prospects for growth in living standards in coming years.</br></br>The Economic Report of the President, released yesterday, said the growth in U.S. productivity, which is a measure of the output per hour worked, has averaged about 2% a year since 1991 -- more than twice the 1978-87 average. Some of that may reflect a rebound from the recession; but even if measured from 1987, productivity has grown 1.2%, up from 0.9% in the 10 previous years.</br></br>""There may have, indeed, been a structural change"" in productivity growth, said Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Such an increase could have positive implications for Americans' standards of living, which are ultimately determined by the productivity of American workers.</br></br>But the president's economic report also points out that it may be too soon to jump to conclusions about productivity growth. For one thing, the statistics can be misleading. If the trends are computed for different periods -- 1978-86 and 1986-94 -- productivity growth averages only 1.1% in the latest period, up from 1% in the earlier period, not much of a difference. Also, recently released Labor Department data on hours worked suggest that productivity could be revised downward by one-tenth of a percentage point in 1993 and 1994.</br></br>""While the evidence of a slight improvement in the productivity growth trend is encouraging, it is not yet decisive,"" the report said, adding that two more years of data may present a clearer picture."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- Business inventories and sales both rose at the same rate in November, suggesting that U.S. merchants and manufacturers were successfully balancing the stocks on their shelves against growing consumer demand.</br></br>Manufacturers, retailers and merchant wholesalers expanded their inventories to $753.56 billion of goods in November, up 0.4% from $750.59 billion in October, the Commerce Department reported. At the same time sales grew to $503.84 billion from $501.91 billion, also a 0.4% increase. The numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations but not for inflation.</br></br>""The inventory area is traditionally where if there are mistakes, we tend to see them,"" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities in Chicago. ""But the truth is that doesn't seem to be occurring. Businesses are keeping inventories in line with overall activities.""</br></br>Fat inventory levels can send mixed economic signals. Rising levels of stocks are healthy if consumers are buying the items. But if businesses overestimate demand, they can be stuck holding goods they can't sell.</br></br>This doesn't seem to have been a problem in recent months. Overall, inventories equaled 1.50 months' sales in November, the same ratio as October and just below September's level of 1.51, the Commerce Department said."
Positive,"A MAJOR EFFORT to lower the dollar against foreign currencies and head off a possible trade war was unveiled by the U.S. and four other nations.

Negative,"The White House and congressional leaders made no progress Monday toward reaching a deficit-reduction deal that would clear the way for raising the federal borrowing limit in less than three weeks.</br></br>President Barack Obama pressed congressional leaders Monday to forge a $4 trillion, 10-year deal. But after another contentious meeting at the White House, the odds that Democrats and Republicans can bridge their differences over taxes and social programs to reach such a sweeping plan ahead of an Aug. 2 debt-limit deadline appeared to diminish.</br></br>Republican leaders in the negotiations presented Mr. Obama with a list of spending cuts that had won tentative support from members of both parties in talks last month led by Vice President Joe Biden. But Mr. Obama said the proposal fell short of reaching the smaller deficit reduction agreement GOP leaders are advocating -- one closer to $2 trillion over 10 years.</br></br>Mr. Obama urged Republicans, as he did in a morning news conference, to think big. ""If not now, when?"" he said.</br></br>Democratic officials familiar with the meetings said there was ""no movement"" toward a deal in the 90-minute session. Democrats continued to demand Republicans include tax increases in a final package, and Republicans continued to resist, according to sources familiar with the discussions. ""Today you saw more real disagreement coming out,"" a Democratic official said."
Negative,"NEW YORK -- A sharp drop in the dollar yesterday created fresh turmoil in the bond markets.</br></br>The dollar's slump aroused renewed concern that foreign investors may cut back on their purchases of dollar-denominated investments at a time when the U.S. is addicted to massive infusions of foreign funds. In addition, traders fear the falling dollar, which makes imported goods more expensive, will intensify pressures for higher inflation and increased interest rates.</br></br>If the dollar continues to fall sharply, the Federal Reserve might react by tightening credit slightly, raising short-term interest rates, analysts say. But most agree that a credit-tightening move isn't likely anytime soon because that could damage the economy and place additional strains on the banking system. The Fed's policy committee meets today in Washington to review strategy.</br></br>In the largest one-day slump since March 4, prices of actively traded Treasury bonds fell about 1 3/4 points, or $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate and municipal bond prices also fell, although not as sharply as Treasury bonds.</br></br>The yield on the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 8.84% from 8.67% last Friday. Late last month, the yield on these bonds stood at about 8 3/8%."
Positive,"Stock prices rebounded modestly from Wednesday's steep slide, but bond prices continued to fall, prompting concern about high long-term interest rates. The dollar rose against European currencies and was unchanged against the yen.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 19.90 to 3244.86 in active trading. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.28 to 411.62. But the Nasdaq Composite Index added a tidy 5.06 to 621.37.</br></br>Yesterday's gains came after a dose of high interest rates Wednesday knocked the Dow Jones industrials for a 47-point loss. The rebound squelched budding fears that Wednesday's sell-off might herald the beginning of a more serious correction.</br></br>But some analysts warned that long-term interest rates are getting dangerously high. As the prices of long-term Treasury bonds have eroded during the past month the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30year bond has risen to 7.78% from 7.39%. A yield of 7.8%, some analysts suggest, may be enough to divert investors away from stocks' uncertain prospects of eventually fatter corporate profits and direct them back to bonds as a competitive investment.</br></br>Bond prices slipped yesterday amid confusion about the Treasury's intentions for financing the federal debt. Yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman told a congressional committee that the administration's budget proposal assumes that the Treasury will place less emphasis on the 30-year bond as a financing instrument than in the past. But he later was quoted as saying that a decision hasn't been made on the amount of 30-year bonds to be sold at next month's refunding auction."
Positive,"NEW YORK -- The economy maintained a hearty pace in November, though it slipped slightly from the previous month's surprisingly robust level, the nation's purchasing managers said.</br></br>The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that production and new order rates slowed from the previous month, but employment rose at the strongest rate in the past 12 months.</br></br>""November's robust showing underscores the strength remaining in the economy as it entered the seventh year of recovery,"" said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's national business survey committee.</br></br>Coming on the heels of the Labor Department's unexpectedly strong November job growth report on Friday, the purchasers' survey could exacerbate concern that the economy isn't cooling down as neatly or as notably as many economists thought. A too-strong economy raises worries that the Federal Reserve Board may curb credit in an effort to head off worrisome inflation.</br></br>The economy has been giving some mixed signals lately, and the purchasers' report also contains some disparate views. Mr. Bretz noted that the survey displayed ""some signs of softening, particularly in the export order growth rate."" But he added that ""the continued healthy level of new orders, combined with a solid downtrend in the inflation rate, virtually assures a strong fourth quarter."""
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit hit another record in November, swelling to $26.50 billion on a surge of imports of foreign cars and consumer goods.</br></br>The deficit in goods and services, seasonally adjusted, was $940 million more than October's revised and record $25.56 billion, the Commerce Department reported. Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.</br></br>But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers: U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising $557 million to $82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products.</br></br>Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to $109.39 billion from October's $107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992.</br></br>While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine. ""The buildup of precautionary inventories ahead of Y2K probably pulled in a few more exports during the fourth quarter,"" said Mark Vitner, economist with First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. ""The continued strength in the U.S. economy, however, is the most important reason imports remain so strong."""
Negative,"BOSTON -- Fidelity Investments, its business taking a hit in the stock-market tumble, said it would lay off 1,695 employees, or 5% of its work force.</br></br>The nation's largest mutual-fund company said the job cuts would focus primarily on market-sensitive operations, such as its big online brokerage unit. But Fidelity said it wouldn't be dismissing any money managers or research analysts.</br></br>Fidelity's assets under management, now $776 billion, have fallen 22% since their peak of $1 trillion on Aug. 31, 2000, a drop that will slash the company's revenue and profit.</br></br>A Fidelity spokeswoman said the company's work force swelled ""when the market roared in the '90s,"" and now the company needed ""to adjust its resources"" to reflect the sharp decline.</br></br>Overall, the company's employment will be down 12%, including attrition, after the latest job cuts from a peak of 33,369 in January 2001. In 2001, Fidelity announced layoffs of 1,114, or about 3% of its work force, mostly from its brokerage units, which had seen a sharp slowdown in trading. In the current round, about half the jobs eliminated will be in Boston, where the company is based, and suburban Marlborough, Mass."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The government reported new evidence of economic recovery, with industrial production and housing starts jumping in February while consumer prices rose modestly.</br></br>Total production by all industries rose 0.6% in February, for its first increase since October, with a strong showing in autos accounting for roughly half of the jump, the Federal Reserve Board reported. That follows a revised decline of 0.8% in January. Industry used 78.2% of its capacity in February, up from 77.9% in January, the Fed said.</br></br>Meanwhile, the prices paid by consumers for goods and services increased 0.3% last month, following a 0.1% January increase, the Labor Department announced, as rises in clothing prices and health-care costs partially offset a drop in energy prices.</br></br>The 9.6% increase in home-building, to an annual rate of 1,304,000, came as low interest rates continued to propel the industry, especially in the Midwest. February single-family housing starts shot up 15%, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>""I think the worst is definitely behind us, and this wave of restructuring has now crested,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ""And while we may see further layoffs, I don't think they'll be of the same magnitude as those of the last year,"" he said, adding that ""I think this recovery is going to take hold, maybe even just in time for Mr. Bush."""
Negative,"Federal Reserve officials are debating whether to strengthen their commitment to keep short-term interest rates near zero as part of their effort to keep boosting the slow-growing economy.</br></br>But they face many unresolved questions about whether to make such a move, and if so when, and several events in the coming days could shed light on their thinking.</br></br>Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday in a hearing on her nomination to lead the Fed when Chairman Ben Bernanke's term ends in January. Mr. Bernanke speaks at the National Economic Club next Tuesday. And the Fed on Wednesday releases minutes of its October meeting, at which the idea likely was discussed.</br></br>The Fed's vow to keep interest rates low for a long time is one of its key tools to rev up the economy, given that it has cut short-term rates nearly to zero. The commitment is one of two pillars of the Fed's easy-money policy, the other one being an $85 billion monthly bond-buying program. Officials might start scaling back the bond-buying program in the coming months, possibly as early as December, but want to reassure the public and investors they won't raise interest rates for a long time after they end the program.</br></br>The Fed has said for months it won't raise short-term interest rates from near zero until the unemployment rate, which was 7.3% in October, falls below 6.5%, as long as inflation doesn't move above 2.5%. Fed officials believe the promise, known as ""forward guidance,"" helps hold down long-term borrowing rates, which in turn encourages borrowing, investment and spending."
Negative,"A sharp pullback in global stock and bond markets has highlighted investors' worries about economic-growth prospects as the Federal Reserve prepares to trim its stimulus spending.</br></br>The selloff this past week evoked the market rout of May and June, when investors were similarly concerned about the Fed's next move.

One-year Treasury-indexed ARMs were 4.02%, down from 4.07% and 4.71%, respectively."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- An unexpected surge in tax receipts in April may help cut the federal budget deficit this year, according to administration and congressional officials.</br></br>The receipts soared to about $120 billion from $91.44 billion a year earlier. While a large rise was expected because of tax-law changes and economic growth, the increase appears to be $5 billion to $10 billion bigger than anticipated.</br></br>""The Treasury is sitting on a humongous pile of cash,"" said Peter Davis, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ""Nobody had any idea of how massive it would be."" Mr. Davis said he has narrowed his deficit estimate for fiscal 1987, which ends Sept. 30, to about $185 billion from as much as $200 billion.</br></br>Treasury and congressional analysts caution that it's too soon to tell whether the surge will mean a smaller deficit for the year; the high April payments could be offset by low receipts later. Moreover, slower economic growth, higher interest rates and increased federal outlays all could swell the deficit.</br></br>Reagan administration budget officials previously have said they expect a fiscal 1987 deficit in the range of $175 billion to $180 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimate is $174 billion. In fiscal 1986, the deficit totaled $220.7 billion."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has a greatly strengthened hand as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen heads to London for tomorrow's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the seven largest industrialized nations.</br></br>In his first meeting with his counterparts from the other Group of Seven nations, Mr. Bentsen is almost certain to argue that the U.S. is finally doing what its allies have demanded: Raising taxes to shrink its budget deficit, helping to reduce pressure on world interest rates and ease inflationary fears.</br></br>In exchange, the U.S. is likely to argue, the Japanese and Germans should do their part to enhance the prospects for world economic growth. From Japan, the U.S. wants stepped-up government spending to stimulate its economy. And from Germany, it wants lower interest rates from the Bundesbank, which would probably require some fiscal belt-tightening by the German government.</br></br>""As I've talked to finance ministers from other parts of the world . . . they are impressed with what we have done,"" Mr. Bentsen told a congressional hearing this week. ""I believe that puts us in a stronger leadership role when we get to deal with these other countries and trying to develop . . . sustained growth in other markets that will be buying our products.""</br></br>Robert Hormats, a Clinton backer who is vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, says Mr. Bentsen goes to London ""in the strongest position of any U.S. Treasury secretary in a G-7 meeting for a decade."""
Negative,"The dollar's relentless decline looks set to continue this week, when an expected interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve will add to the forces arrayed against the sagging currency.</br></br>Already under intense pressure from signs the U.S. is in recession and the crisis atmosphere in the U.S. financial sector, the dollar's fall last week through some significant psychological levels has intensified negative market sentiment.</br></br>The euro breached $1.55 to hit another set of lifetime highs against the dollar. The U.S. currency on Friday traded below parity with the Swiss franc for the first time. It likewise is in full retreat versus the yen, falling below 100 yen to its lowest levels in nearly 13 years.</br></br>This is the dark corner from which the dollar confronts the likelihood of another considerable Federal Reserve rate cut tomorrow that would only put it at a greater disadvantage against currencies from countries where rates are higher.</br></br>That prospect has many wondering whether tomorrow's expected rate cut might not tip the dollar's deterioration into a disorderly rout, in turn requiring coordinated central-bank intervention to restore some two-way risk to the market."
Negative,"Investors swapped out of U.S. equity funds and into bonds at the fastest clip on record in the most recent week, according to Lipper Inc., as they grasped for safety while the stock market swooned.</br></br>Traditional U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds together saw withdrawals of $18.8 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their biggest weekly withdrawals on record.

Emerging-market stock funds shed $2.7 billion in the most-recent week, the biggest outflow since February 2011, compared with $2.6 billion a week earlier.</br></br>Virtually all of the shift came from money sloshing out of U.S. stock ETFs and into bond ETFs, which often can see big weekly asset swings. Just $386 million flowed out of traditional U.S. stock mutual funds in the most recent week. Traditional bond mutual funds attracted $1.2 billion. Helping drive that shift was one fast-moving ETF money manager, Good Harbor Financial LLC. It cashed in roughly $5 billion in U.S. stock ETFs on Monday and bought roughly that same amount in ETFs made up of Treasury bonds, the firm's chief executive, Paul Ingersoll, confirmed with The Wall Street Journal Monday."

Positive,"What a ride! With the economy behaving in almost perfect fashion, stock prices enjoyed some of their strongest gains in years. After opening the year in a pessimistic mood, investors turned joyous as the Dow Jones Industrial Average charged through the 4000 and 5000 milestones before the end of the year.</br></br>By year end, most every investor had reason to smile. The Dow, up 33.45%, edged out most of the mutual funds, but even those laggards had a good year. And all these gains came with little queasiness. According to Ned Davis Research Inc., Nokomis, Fla., the Dow's biggest correction in 1995 was a record low 3.3%. In addition, Ned Davis Research says the Dow, which hit its last bear market bottom in October 1990, has put in its longest run ever without a 10% correction.</br></br>But the spectacular year required something akin to a razor's edge dance by the economy. The enriching combination of modest growth with good profits -- the so-called soft landing -- came about despite a great deal of cynicism that it could ever happen.</br></br>Can that perfect combination continue? Most analysts now say yes. Sort of. Few expect another raucous year with gains of more than 30%. Instead, the bull market will have a return to normalcy, with consensus expectations hovering around a 10% return for the year.</br></br>Of course, it must be noted early on that many chin-scratchers erred badly in their 1995 outlooks a year ago. The consensus expected some sort of correction in the stock market, with prices moving higher later in the year. But hardly anyone thought the Dow would cruise past 5000."
Negative,"Weaker than expected retail sales figures for May blew the scent of recession back into the bond market yesterday, a worry that sparked one of the bigger one-day rallies of the past year.</br></br>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose nearly 2 1/4 points to 114 1/32, or about $22.50 for every $1,000 bond. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.54%.</br></br>Movement in the Treasury's two year note was even more dramatic. Its price which is roughly six times more sensitive to movements than the 30-year bond, rose nearly 5/8 of a point, while its yield fell 31 hundredths of a percentage point to 5.61%, its biggest one-day move in five years.</br></br>Traders, investors and economists said the weak retail sales figures for May -- a 0.2% gain compared with expectations of 0.6% -- confirmed suspicions about the economy's weakness. Moreover, they said once again Federal Reserve Board policy makers are under pressure to cut short-term rates soon.</br></br>""The fundamentals are now more positive [for a cut in rates] than when we had the weak unemployment numbers [on June 2],"" said Lee Quaintance, head of government bond trading at CS First Boston."
Positive,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new high for the year following a generally upbeat assessment from the Federal Reserve, which left interest rates unchanged.</br></br>The Fed signaled that the prospects for the economy are improving, helping to keep stocks up across the board even though the rate decision was anticipated. Many investors said they were relieved the Fed didn't signal excessive nervousness about inflation, though it did give one of its first indications that it might raise interest rates later this year if the economic turnaround continues.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.54%, or 57.50 points, at 10635.25. That's just above the previous high for the year, hit a week ago, of 10632.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 0.41%, or 4.74 points to 1170.29.

Negative,"In the matter of Occupy Wall Street, the allegedly anticapitalist movement that's been camped out in lower Manhattan for the past few weeks and has inspired copycat protests from Boston to Los Angeles, we have some sympathy. Really? Well, yeah.</br></br>OK, not for the half-naked demonstrators, the ranting anti-Semites, Kanye West or anyone else who has helped make Occupy Wall Street a target for easy ridicule. But to the extent that the mainly young demonstrators have a valid complaint, it's that they are trying to bust their way into an economy where there is one job for every five job-seekers, and where youth unemployment runs north of 18%. That is a cause for frustration, if not outrage.</br></br>The question is, outrage at whom? On Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street marched on J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters, after having protested outside CEO Jamie Dimon's home the previous day. That's odd, seeing that J.P. Morgan didn't take on excessive mortgage risk and didn't need (although it was forced to take) TARP money. The demonstrators also picketed the home of hedge fund mogul John Paulson, who made much of his recent fortune betting against the housing bubble, not helping to inflate it.</br></br>As for Wall Street itself, on Tuesday New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report predicting that the financial industry will likely lose 10,000 jobs by the end of next year. That's on top of the 4,100 jobs lost since April, and the 22,000 since the beginning of 2008. Overall New York-area employment in finance and insurance has declined by 8.9% since late 2006. Even Goldman Sachs is planning layoffs.</br></br>So much for the cliche of Wall Street versus Main Street, the greedy 1% versus the hard-done-by 99%. That may be the core conviction of Occupy Wall Street and its fellow-travelers, and it may be a slogan in nearly every Democratic campaign next year, including President Obama's. Whether or not that's smart Democratic politics, the voters will decide."

Data Resources says it's the same one that got stung worst in the last four economic downturns: the Great Lakes states.</br></br>The Lexington, Mass., economic-consulting firm has produced a scenario that assumes a relatively severe recession starting in late 1989, with the nation's economic output falling four percentage points by the fourth quarter of 1990 and interest rates surging. In this model, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin would lose 10% of their manufacturing jobs by the end of 1990.</br></br>Does all this sound familiar? In the major recessions of 1975 and 1982, and in the less severe slumps of 1960 and 1970, the Great Lakes states also sustained the biggest percentage job losses of any region."
Negative,"Borrowing for U.S. colleges declined for the third year in a row as the federal government clamped down on for-profit schools and families became more cost-conscious.</br></br>Federal and private-loan lending totaled $106 billion for the 2013-14 academic year, down 8% from the prior year, according to a report to be released Thursday by the nonprofit College Board. The decline marks a significant reversal in borrowing, which peaked at $122.1 billion in 2010-11 after rising for years.</br></br>The drop is partly due to a decline in enrollment at for-profit colleges, where most students borrow and where default rates are generally higher. The schools have come under increased scrutiny since 2010, when a report by the Government Accountability Office found deceptive practices that ranged from promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students to not disclosing total tuition costs for students before they enrolled.</br></br>At traditional colleges, families have been cutting back on expenses, experts say. A growing share of students are commuting from home rather than living on campus, for example, according to a report issued earlier this year by SLM Corp., the largest private student lender, also known as Sallie Mae.</br></br>An improving economy and stock market are also likely contributing to families borrowing less, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors.com, a Las Vegas-based firm that tracks financial aid and student loans. As the unemployment rate has declined and the stock market has improved, parents have been able to access more cash than during the downturn, he says."

Positive,"WASHINGTON -- With the nation's underlying inflation falling, the Federal Reserve yesterday softened its hawkish inflation stance a bit while squelching any suggestion it might cut interest rates soon.</br></br>The central bank, in the statement issued at the end of its two-day meeting, sidestepped the question of whether the current inflation rate is low enough. It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest- rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.""</br></br>As widely expected, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year.</br></br>In the accompanying statement, it said, that ""readings on core inflation,"" which excludes food and energy, ""have improved modestly in recent months,"" a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting, on May 9, when it said ""core inflation remains somewhat elevated.""</br></br>But it added: ""Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.

Positive,"NEW YORK -- Bond mutual funds turned in a workmanlike year in 1992 despite a flat fourth quarter.</br></br>Taxable bond funds had an average 7.87% return for the year, including price changes and reinvested dividends, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a Summit, N.J., company that tracks mutual fund returns. That total return exceeded the 3.1% inflation rate, but it lagged behind stock funds' 8.88% average return.</br></br>The year's best performers were junk bond funds and convertible bond funds, which, like the stock market, got a boost from the long-delayed economic recovery. But foreign bond funds were hurt by currency upheaval in Europe.</br></br>Taxable bond funds finished with a nearly flat fourth quarter, gaining a scant 0.18%. Prices fell and yields rose on intermediate- and short-term debt securities, reducing the funds' returns.</br></br>The respectable gains come at a time when bond fund sales are soaring. Investors, disenchanted with lowly yields on money market funds, poured $88.4 billion into bond funds during the first 11 months of 1992. Last year's inflow was the second-best ever, surpassed only by 1986, when bond funds pulled in $108.6 billion."
Positive,"FASTER ECONOMIC GROWTH finally brings some cheer to many states.</br></br>As the economy perks up, tax collectors report higher revenues. State revenue, even excluding tax increases, rose faster than inflation in the third quarter, says the Center for the Study of the States in Albany, N.Y. That was the first time this has happened in any quarter since late 1990. Oregon and Utah posted especially strong gains. Total state revenue rose 4.3%, without tax-law changes, up from sluggish second-quarter growth of 2.6% and anemic first-quarter growth of 1%.</br></br>But growth generally remains ""far from robust,"" says Steven Gold, the center's director, and many states remain depressed. The mid-Atlantic region posted the smallest improvement, and California's budget woes worry bond investors. This year, fewer states raised taxes than last year. Total third-quarter state revenue, including tax increases, rose 7.6%, down from second-quarter growth of 8.9%.</br></br>Ohio, facing an estimated $300 million deficit, may increase taxes soon, an aide to Gov.

Positive,"One of the great moments from the Starr Report is when Monica Lewinsky earnestly offers the American President her thoughts on education. But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs.</br></br>Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment.</br></br>And what a reward it is: $1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians! The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7% of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over; the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal.</br></br>Just for reference: Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9% of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4% of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War (19% in 1952), Vietnam (19.7% in 1969) and the Cold War (19.7% of 1981). He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up.</br></br>It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by $143 billion, or 9%, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of $126.2 billion, or 8.7%, from 1996 to 1997."

Citigroup Inc. would try to sell off its broker-dealer units first before letting the parent company fail under one scenario. Bank of America Corp. said the ""simplest approach"" to winding down its business would be through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by its holding company, with its subsidiaries continuing to operate.

Negative,"Economy May Be Getting Its Wings Clipped</br></br>Here is the stuff of nightmares: You are piloting a plane that is losing altitude and not responding.</br></br>As the Federal Reserve concludes a two-day meeting Wednesday, it may be presented with fresh data hinting at such a calamity for the U.S. economy. First-class passengers like Mr. Stock Market appear blithely unaware as they enjoy a complimentary beverage. Those crammed in coach are starting to feel some bumps.</br></br>The economy isn't in a recession, but it will probably remain near what economists call ""stall speed"" following Wednesday's report on second-quarter gross domestic product. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires see annualized growth of just 0.9% -- tied for the second-lowest level of the expansion.</br></br>That follows growth of 1.8% and 0.4% in the previous two quarters. Growth below 2% for multiple quarters is thought to heighten the risk of recession."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department, in predicting a fifth consecutive year of economic expansion in 1987, expects a significant narrowing of the nation's trade deficit.</br></br>In its annual Industrial Outlook, a detailed analysis of 250 goods-producing industries and more than 130 service-sector industries, the department forecasts that about 70% of U.S. manufacturing industries will record increased shipments.</br></br>At a news conference Wednesday, Deputy Commerce Secretary Clarence Brown said the department's most optimistic forecasts estimate that the merchandise trade gap could narrow by as much as $40 billion this year.</br></br>The deficit in 1986 is believed to have swelled to as much as $170 billion, and many private economists anticipate less improvement in 1987 than Mr. Brown suggested. In a separate report released yesterday, the department said the nation's merchandise trade deficit expanded to a record $19.22 billion in November.</br></br>Mr. Brown said manufactured exports are expected to grow faster than imports for the first time since 1980. The improving trade balance, he said, is due to the dollar's decline against major foreign currencies, U.S. efforts to encourage more-balanced growth and trade-liberalization abroad, and strict enforcement of U.S. trade laws."
Positive,"Stock prices soared as the nation's banks bowed to pressure for lower interest rates. The dollar rose, especially against the Japanese yen, while bond prices posted only modest gains.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 42.33 points to 2930.20 in active trading. Other, broader measures of stock prices rose, too. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 380.29, up 4.94 points, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, a measure of small stock prices, was up 3.13 to 487.85.</br></br>The stock market gains came as banks across the country cut their prime lending rate -- on which many consumer and corporate loans are based -- to 8.5% from 9%. Those moves followed the Federal Reserve Board's cut on Tuesday of the discount rate -- which it charges member financial institutions for short-term loans -- to 5.5% from 6%.</br></br>Interest rates are being reduced in hopes of stimulating the moribund U.S. economy. Investors had been worrying that without further stimulation to the economy, the recession would continue for several months more.</br></br>Analysts said stock prices got an extra boost from the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly survey, which indicated slightly more industrial activity is expected during the coming months. Although the purchasing managers' index remains far below the level that indicates a growing economy, the gain to 42.1% in April from 40% in March was encouraging."
Negative,"CHICAGO -- Economists are likely to sharply increase their food-inflation forecasts in coming weeks if dry weather continues in the Farm Belt, as is expected.</br></br>Until recently, economists generally expected retail food prices to rise 3% to 4% this year. But if this spring's dry weather turns into a drought, says Vincent Malanga, president of LaSalle Economics Inc., it could reduce crop yields so much that by autumn the inflation figure may hit 7% to 8%.</br></br>Three big farm states -- Iowa, Illinois and Indiana -- have had their driest spring since the Dust Bowl year of 1934, says Peter Leavitt of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass. Most forecasters expect the hot, dry weather to continue for several weeks.</br></br>""We think food can be a major catalyst of inflation in 1989,"" Mr. Malanga said.</br></br>The dry weather and growing fears of shortages are already setting off inflation alarms. Farm prices, buoyed by rallying hog and soybean prices, rose 3.1% in May alone, according to figures released yesterday by the Agriculture Department."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- Lower oil prices are expected to spur solid gains in consumers' purchasing power in coming months despite the small increase in personal income in March.</br></br>Personal income rose 0.2% last month, following a revised 0.4% increase in February, the Commerce Department reported. Consumer spending last month increased 0.3% following a revised 0.4% rise in February. The income rise was originally put at 0.6% and the spending increase, at 0.3%.</br></br>""Income is growing very slowly,"" said Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ""But thanks to the oil price cut, people are in effect getting a tax cut.""</br></br>A spending-based price measure reported after a one-month lag fell 0.4% in February after increasing 0.3% in January. After adjusting for price changes, February spending rose 0.9%.</br></br>""Once you get the low inflation numbers factored in, the numbers don't look so weak,"" said Robert Wescott, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. He noted that consumers also are benefiting from the decline in interest rates."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- A trade deficit wider than expected and strong retail sales signaled that the economy remains on a solid upward trajectory but prompted concerns in the markets that inflation is heating up.</br></br>The trade gap widened 3.6% to a record $48.3 billion in April, from March's $46.6 billion, according to the Commerce Department. The deficit reflected a decline in exports of $1.5 billion, while imports remained largely flat. The drop covered a broad range of exports, but a number of analysts dismissed it as a statistical aberration.</br></br>""Over the last year, exports were up 10%; over the last three months, exports rose almost 20% at an annual rate,"" says John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns. ""The trend is unambiguously higher."" The National Association of Manufacturers also dismissed the decline as ""a one-time correction.""</br></br>The widening trade deficit could put downward pressure on the dollar as investors lose confidence in the ability of the U.S. to repay its debts, boosting the prices of imports higher than they otherwise would be. But the deficit can also be a signal of economic strength. That is because the U.S. is growing more rapidly than other industrialized nations and absorbing more imports than its trading partners.</br></br>Retail sales, which grew at a 1.2% pace in May, compared with a 0.6% drop in April, was another signal of a strengthening U.S. economy. May's growth drew on a healthier job market and aggressive discounting at car dealerships looking to counter higher gasoline prices. Light- vehicle sales among the Big Three U.S. auto makers rose 14.6% in May compared with the month before, the National Automobile Dealers Association said."
Positive,"The government's barometer of future economic activity rose in December, along with sales of new homes and help-wanted ads in newspapers, giving further evidence that the economy is gaining momentum.</br></br>The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators jumped a vigorous 0.7% in December, the fifth monthly rise in a row, bringing the index to its highest level since April 1989.</br></br>The index is designed to forecast future economic health. Eight of the 11 indicators that make up the index improved. The most robust indicators were consumer expectations, materials prices and initial claims for unemployment benefits. Capital equipment, unfilled orders for durable goods and the money supply were down very slightly or unchanged.</br></br>Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago said, ""We're in a full-fledged cyclical expansion. Before we had one or more of the cylinders of the economy not working. Now they are all running.""</br></br>Separately, sales of new homes shot up 11.4% in December to an annual rate of 862,000, the highest in seven years, according to a report by the Commerce Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
Positive,"The dollar gained against the yen and the euro on Tuesday after the U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace in 11 years, bolstering the market's expectations for higher interest rates.</br></br>The dollar increased 0.6% in late-afternoon trade to 120.77 yen, a two-week high. The euro pushed to a more than two-year low in early trade and was recently down 0.5% to $1.2169.</br></br>U.S. gross domestic product grew 5% in the third quarter, well above last month's estimate of 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the fastest pace since GDP grew 6.9% during the third quarter of 2003.</br></br>The GDP data encouraged investors who have been betting that a recovering U.S. economy would spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before other major central banks do. Higher U.S. rates would bring more investors to the dollar, as they would increase returns on assets denominated in the currency.</br></br>""With 5% growth in the U.S. now, even if we don't improve at that pace next quarter, we're still light years ahead of the eurozone and Japan,"" said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust Private Wealth Management."
Positive,"WASHINGTON -- Weak payroll growth and declining unemployment suggest that the U.S. job market is growing at a slow but steady pace.</br></br>Employers added a disappointing 110,000 jobs in March, the fewest since July and a big decline from 243,000 in February, the Labor Department reported. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February.</br></br>Economists believe that last month's lackluster performance in payroll growth is an indication of businesses turning more cautious in the face of profit pressures and another spike in energy prices.</br></br>Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.4% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity was relatively unchanged at 55.2 in March. The new-orders index ticked higher to 57.1 from 55.8, while the employment gauge slipped to 53.3 from 57.4.</br></br>Index readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding. The March number represents the 22nd consecutive month of manufacturing growth."

Positive,"NEW YORK -- Seldom has the economy so confounded forecasters. Who could possibly have imagined a year ago that overall business activity -- notwithstanding an unprecedented crash in the stock market -- would remain briskly on the rise in mid-1988? Who could have guessed that the expansion would be rolling relentlessly through a sixth straight year, with no end in sight?</br></br>Economists who failed to anticipate this durability may be tempted to despair, sensing that imponderables so overhang the business scene nowadays that forecasting has grown too hazardous an occupation. Indeed, they may be moved to seek safer work, like wrestling with alligators instead of numbers.</br></br>Before anyone sets out for the Everglades, however, it may be worth taking a retrospective look at the economy's recent behavior, for it's not as perplexing as one might suppose from all the tarnished forecasting records.</br></br>Expansion phases of the business cycle normally end only after a rising economy begins to bump against constraints to further growth. These constraints may be physical, as when labor or productive capacity proves insufficient to meet demand, or they may be financial, as when credit is too costly or simply unavailable.</br></br>This basic characteristic of the business cycle tended to be overlooked in the widespread concern last year, particularly after the October market crash, that a recession would soon set in, possibly by the start of 1988."
Positive,"PHILIP MORRIS IS CUTTING the price of Marlboro cigarettes by up to 20% and plans to forgo increases on other major brands while expanding distribution of discount brands. The moves, reflecting a decline in brand loyalty, could slash the company's tobacco profit by 40%. Its stock plummeted $14.75, or 23%, to $49.375. Other tobacco stocks also tumbled.</br></br>Stocks plunged, triggered by sliding tobacco shares and a weak employment report, while bond prices sank. The Dow Jones industrials fell 68.63 points, or 2%, to 3370.81.

Negative,"Kroger Charges Less; What Price Victory?</br></br>While some investors tremble at the prospect of inflation, grocers like Kroger wouldn't mind a little more of it.</br></br>The biggest U.S. grocery-store chain is due on Tuesday morning to report earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in November. Analysts, on average, estimate it earned 37 cents a share in the quarter, down slightly from 39 cents a year ago.</br></br>So far, recession-generated price competition is hurting most traditional grocery-store chains, as shellshocked consumers have fled to cheaper, big-box competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores and Costco Wholesale. On Wal-Mart's earnings call last month, Chief Executive Mike Duke said Wal-Mart plans to ""widen the gap with our competitors on price leadership.""</br></br>Those grocery chains that have managed to maintain or expand their market share, like Kroger, have done so at the expense of profit margins. Kroger's size has helped it cut prices more deeply than smaller peers such as Safeway and Supervalu, leading to market-share gains."
Negative,"Stocks fell from multiyear highs as the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting offered no signals that monetary stimulus is on the way.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a three-session streak of gains, declining 64.94 points, or 0.5%, to 13199.55, one day after notching its highest close in more than four years.

Positive,"AFTER TWO down months, stocks surprised investors with a rebound -- just as the Federal Reserve meets today to take what is expected to be a first step toward higher interest rates.</br></br>Despite uncertainty about how soon and how much the Fed will raise rates, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 88.43 points, or 0.86%, to 10314.00, still down 1.3% since the year began.</br></br>Whether this proves to be a one-day bounce or a more lasting rebound depends heavily on whether the Fed damps investors' enthusiasm by signaling a sooner-rather-than-later rate increase.</br></br>Investors widely expect Fed policy makers to leave their target overnight lending rate at 1%, a 46-year low, for now. Low Fed targets have helped keep most market interest rates down, helping stocks and bonds for more than 18 months.</br></br>Many expect the Fed today will end its promise to be ""patient"" about raising rates. Whether stocks and bonds rise or fall probably depends on whether the Fed signals plans to raise rates at its next meeting, in June, or instead to wait until its August meeting."
Negative,"In a bear market, sometimes any news is bad news.</br></br>When unemployment hit a nine-year low Jan. 8, stocks responded with a 140-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some investors were worried: A strong economy might step up inflation.</br></br>When December's inflation came in at just 0.1% a few weeks later, some traders still saw only gloom: Federal Reserve Governor Wayne Angell warned that the Fed might tighten credit because the 4.4% inflation for all 1987 was too high.</br></br>And when a slew of high-tech companies such as NCR Corp. reported earnings that matched or exceeded expectations on Jan. 20, that was still bad news: Their stocks fell on fears that their earnings will crumble in 1988.</br></br>Individually, such reactions may be perfectly logical. Together, they add up to bear-market psychology. ""As a rule of thumb, in a bear market, bullish news hardly matters, and bearish news has a dramatic impact,"" says George Pirrone, a stock trader at Dreyfus Corp."
Negative,"Volatility isn't just a Wall Street phenomenon. It is hitting Main Street, too.</br></br>So far, incoming September economic reports have been surprisingly firm. Auto sales rebounded to their highest level since April. Chain-store sales posted year-on-year growth of 5.5%. The economy added 103,000 jobs, and manufacturing sentiment improved a bit. On Friday, Commerce Department figures are expected to show a strong 0.8% monthly increase in retail and food-service sales, while consumer sentiment may show some brightening of attitudes as well.</br></br>What? If this feels like a 180-degree turn from August, it basically is. It would be one thing if this were a special case, or a broad turning point. But these jerky swings have become the norm. Consider what has happened so far this year: Real gross domestic product shrank in January and February, according to tracking firm Macroeconomic Advisers. Then it surged more than 1% in March. It contracted again in May and June -- only to jump more than 1% again in July.</br></br>This isn't typical. Since 1992, monthly GDP has fallen about a third of the time when the economy hasn't been in recession. This year, even assuming a small gain in August, monthly GDP has fallen about half the time. It is even less common to see GDP growth above 1% in any given month; that usually happens only about once a year. In the first half of 2011 alone, it happened twice.</br></br>No surprise, then, that stocks have been swinging wildly. After sinking to just shy of bear-market territory, the S&P 500 jumped nearly 8% in the eight trading sessions through Thursday. That rally is predicated in part on figures showing the U.S. is likely to avoid recession for the rest of the year. At least, in traditional terms. But RBC Capital Markets economist Tom Porcelli cautions the economy remains vulnerable to growth scares he calls ""flash recessions."""
Negative,"A mild stock rally fizzled late today, overwhelmed by computerized selling strategies and anxiety that has afflicted investors since the historic market collapse exactly six months ago.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks, up more than 32 points at midafternoon, slid in the final hours and finished down 8.62 to 1999.50, back under the 2000 level for the first time in two weeks. Most broader market indices also fell.</br></br>""People are willing to venture into the market on a day-by-day basis, but not much longer,"" said Joseph Barthel, technical analyst at the Butcher & Singer Co. investment firm. ""Without some sort of clarification, I think we're doomed to this type of whipsaw action.""</br></br>The market strengthened through the early hours, largely because of sharply higher earnings reported by some leading companies that constitute the Dow average. A partial recovery in the slumping bond market also helped by easing interest rates, thereby making bonds a less attractive alternative to stocks.</br></br>But bonds weakened in the afternoon on renewed fears of inflation and fighting in the Persian Gulf. Traders said this helped provide an excuse to bail out of stocks and erase the day's gains."
Positive,"One secessionist says succinctly: Name another city that has a mountain range running through it. And geography is but one reason why the two-fifths of this city that sprawls north of the Santa Monica Mountains may try to do what 11 states attempted in the 1860s and 13 colonies did in 1776: declare independence.</br></br>Tom McClintock, a state assemblyman, is to the San Fernando Valley's secession what John Calhoun was to the South's -- the most trenchant theorist: ""The ultimate check on an abusive or dysfunctional government is the ability of people to walk away from it.""

Thus was made a young conservative and a California family: ""The ability to walk away from a dysfunctional government is what brought {my family} out here.""</br></br>Now he is 41 and determined to midwife the birth of what would be the nation's sixth largest city. (Los Angeles would drop to third, behind New York and Chicago, and ahead of Houston and Philadelphia.) Sliced off of Los Angeles, the valley would be the nation's second most affluent city of more than one million. Today its per capita income is $19,021, second only to San Francisco's $19,695. In the rest of Los Angeles the figure is $14,668. The valley is 4 percent African American, 8 percent Asian American and has a large Latino population. Spanish is spoken in a quarter of all homes, and 38 percent of adults are foreign born.</br></br>Los Angeles, McClintock says, grew ""like the old Soviet Union,"" by ""gobbling up"" contiguous communities, such as Hollywood and many others. It used its ownership of water rights to lure communities into an imperial city.</br></br>The result is a city of 467 square miles, large enough to hold St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Boston and Pittsburgh, with room remaining for Manhattan. Another result, says McClintock, is a city where ""local government is not local."""
Positive,"The stock market has performed magnificently of late.

Negative,"The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.</br></br>However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.</br></br>Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.</br></br>The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.</br></br>Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components."
Negative,"After years of skyrocketing increases, national health care spending rose only 6.4 percent in 1994, the ""slowest growth rate recorded in more than three decades,"" the Medicare Office of National Health Statistics reported yesterday.</br></br>The figures, published in the magazine Health Affairs, show that health spending by all public and private sources totaled $949.4 billion in calendar year 1994, the latest year for which data have been calculated, or $3,510 for each person in the United States.</br></br>From 1988 to 1992 the nation experienced double-digit and near-double-digit increases in health spending each year. The rate eased to 7 percent in 1993 and the growth rate now has fallen again to 6.4 percent. Despite the small 1994 rise, U.S. health spending still makes up a higher proportion of gross domestic product than any other developed nation's, 13.7 percent in 1994.</br></br>Authors Katharine Levit, Helen Lazenby and Lekha Sivarajan said the slow rate of increase appears to stem from employers switching coverage for their workers from conventional fee-for-service plans to health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans that often charge less. Low inflation also is a contributing factor.</br></br>The new figures appear to support the arguments of health analysts like Gail Wilensky, who chairs the Congressional Physician Payment Review Commission, and GOP members of Congress, like Rep.

Our old zero-sum assumptions - profits and productivity versus the birds and the trees - have given way to a new understanding of the relationships between economics and ecology. ""Doing well"" is increasingly being associated with ""doing good"" for the earth. Conservation is no longer being seen as an inhibitor to growth, but as a stimulus for efficiency. Environmental responsibility is no longer some corporate feel-good issue, but an obligation - to customers, investors, employees, communities and others. To that extent, the notion of ""greener"" companies can be a win-win proposition, with salutary effects for both business and the earth.</br></br>That's an underlying message from Frances Cairncross, who argues in Costing the Earth that the partnership of clear-sighted economic policies and resourceful companies can survive, even thrive, in the new era of global environmental concern.</br></br>As environmental editor for the British magazine the Economist, Cairncross has a perspective rooted firmly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean, where ""government regulation"" hasn't yet earned the same public scorn as ""acid rain.""

Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.</br></br>The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.</br></br>Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits.

Positive,"The annual report of the president's Council of Economic Advisers released yesterday begins not with cautious assessment but a sweeping celebratory declaration: ""The past year saw the nation's economy turn in its best performance in a generation.""</br></br>The report ticked off the now-familiar figures for strong economic growth -- the rapid rise in jobs, the drop in unemployment to a 24-year low and a decline in core inflation to the lowest level since the mid-1960s. ""The economy is remarkably free of the symptoms that often presage an economic downturn -- such as an increase in inflation, an accumulation of inventories or evidence of financial imbalance,"" the council members wrote in the report.</br></br>Only in the administration's forecast for the next three years does the CEA turn cautiously conservative.</br></br>Like many private-sector economists, those at the CEA believe that some special factors, such as the huge run-up in the stock market, helped push inflation-adjusted economic growth to 3.2 percent in 1996 and 3.9 percent last year. As the impact of those forces wanes, so, too, will the nation's growth rate, which is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year and stay there for 1999 and 2000.</br></br>""We have had an utterly exceptional rate of growth,"" which has reduced unemployment to a level at or below that regarded as full employment by many economists, CEA Chairman Janet L. Yellen told reporters. ""Our forecast is sufficient to keep the economy operating in that full-employment range."""

Since January 1995, Maryland has cut its statewide caseload by 30 percent, while Prince George's has shown a 16 percent reduction, to 27,300 welfare recipients. Baltimore has reduced its caseload by 25,000 people, or 24 percent, despite a higher unemployment rate.</br></br>Kim Rhim, a consultant hired by Prince George's to review the training of caseworkers and managers, said many workers do not understand the new welfare policies, communicate seldom with managers and have not been trained to perform their new duty of helping people find jobs.</br></br>""Employees said that things are changing so quickly that they sometimes get information from the clients,"" said Rhim, executive director of Training Source Inc., which also does training and job placement. ""The average employee is frustrated, overworked and overwhelmed. A lot of {caseworkers} are processing people as though welfare will be around forever.""</br></br>Rhim said management must make more of an effort to talk directly to employees about changes, instead of passing along written information -- without explanation -- about new policies. And Rhim said employees need immediate training on how to steer potential welfare recipients into jobs. ""The newest part of their job is to talk about jobs, and they don't know how to do it,"" she said. ""As a result, some employees are doing business as usual."""
Negative,"The Federal Reserve, seeing few signs of a financial crisis in Fri-day???s big stock market drop, yesterday added $2 billion in cash to the banking system in such a restrained way that it convinced most analysts not to look for a sharp drop in interest rates.</br></br>Some analysts said they thought the stock market drop likely would cause the Fed to lower the federal funds rate???the key interest rate financial institutions charge one another for overnight loans???from about 9 percent to 8.75 percent or a bit less.</br></br>But Federal Reserve officials, like their counterparts elsewhere in government, are waiting to see whether the market decline re- i sumes.

Negative,"Federal Reserve officials concluded early last month that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had pushed the nation into a recession, according to minutes of an Oct. 2 policymaking session released yesterday.</br></br>Details of the minutes, including the policymakers' conclusion that the economy is in a slump, reinforced the view among many economists that the Fed is not done cutting rates. The economists generally expect the Fed to lower its target to 1.5 percent, probably in two quarter-point steps at meetings scheduled for mid-December and late January.</br></br>""The economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the [attacks] seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity,"" the members of the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded, the minutes said.</br></br>""Looking ahead, the members generally saw a relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year as a plausible forecast but one that was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty, notably in the direction of a potentially much weaker outcome in the nearer term,"" they said.</br></br>The minutes are a summary of the officials' discussions, not a transcript, and the word ""recession"" does not appear in the minutes.

It was the first increase since 1987 when the deficit hit a record $152.1 billion.</br></br>The Labor Department also reported that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, the biggest monthly rise in two years.

Negative,"President Kennedy???s warning that we face a 7 per cent unemployment rate even without a recession unless we step up our rate of economic growth ought to waken the whole country to the importance of a reduction now in the war-born tax rates that are dragging down the national economy.</br></br>Tiie consequences of a slow rate of growth become more understandable then staled in human terms of rising unemployment. As the President pointed out, an economy expanding at the rate of 3 per cent is producing jobs at the rate of 10 million in 15 years while the civilian labor force is growing at the rate of 12 million in 15 years. Even with relative prosperity, the result is going to be rising unemployment. The country lost as much by the idleness of those willing but unable to find work in 1962, the President told an audience in Chicago last Saturday, as it would lose from shut-ing down the whole country and suspending all production, services and pay for three weeks. This is an intolerable waste which a civilized state cannot countenance.</br></br>200.000	jobs a year, from the schools which will put 26 million new young workers on the labor market in the 60s, from automation which is enabling 800,000 fewer workers to produce 20 per cent more manufactured goods.</br></br>There are many specific projects required to take care of the particular needs of different pools of labor, but none of these narrow approaches will have the total effect on employment that could be achieved by a tax cut of $10 billion which the President has recommended. To attack separately the problem of each idle group, in the long run, will be as ineffective as meeting the problems of a leaky roof with a bucket for each drip. Some of this may have to be done, in areas and age-groups and labor elements with special and peculiar problems that even relatively full employment will not solve. But this is a clean-up job, a mopping-up operation, a bit of social tidying up to be done in addition to raising general employment to acceptable levels.</br></br>Such benefits as those contemplated in the bill to set up a Youth Conservation Corps and a Home Town Youth Corps for example are only patches on the main problem.

Negative,"Economic indicators released Friday confirmed what tight-fisted American consumers have already concluded: The economy may be recovering, but barely.</br></br>Retail sales grew 0.4 percent in July after falling a revised 0.3 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported. The increase was the first one in three months and was mainly attributable to a rebound in auto sales boosted by dealer incentives. Department store sales declined 1 percent, and sales at clothing stores fell 0.7 percent. Despite the slight gain, sales failed to meet expectations.</br></br>Business inventories, a key piece of data that economists use to judge the growth of the wider economy, rose for the sixth consecutive month in June to 0.3 percent. Sales at the wholesale level fell for the second month in a row, although the 0.6 percent decline was significantly less than the 1.2 percent drop in May.</br></br>Consumer sentiment is similarly lukewarm. An index of what they think about the economy by Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan rose to 69.6 in early August from 67.8 in July, which had been the lowest level since November, Reuters reported. Despite the small increase, consumers did not anticipate an improved economy any time soon.</br></br>Consumer inflation edged up for the first time in four months and slightly above forecasts to 0.3 percent in July, adjusted for seasonal variations, according to the Labor Department. The gain was mainly due to an increase in energy costs. Overall inflation, excluding the volatile statistics for energy and food, rose only 0.1 percent."

To show the dimensions of these investments, principally American, between October 1955 and March 1957, net direct investments amounted to Canadian S639 million; net new security issues amounted to Canadian $701 million; trade in outstanding securities amounted to Canadian $300 million; other capital flows amounted to Canadian $390 million.

After the Korean boom, there were significant tax reductions for fiscal years 1953-54 and 1955-56. The tax reductions for 1953-54 consisted mainly in eliminating a surchai???ge' on individual income taxes and a reduction in the corporate profits tax. Similar but small reductions characterized the rate changes for 1955-56, introduced when the extent and timing of the economic recovery was still unknown. For 1957-58, there were smaller cuts in indirect taxes, reducing aggregate tax revenues by about 1 per cent and still leaving an increased budget surplus.???"
Negative,"President Reagan???s economic policies are unfair. Interest rates are out of control. Unemployment is far too high.</br></br>President Reagan is a strong leader. He is effective in dealing with Congress. He represented the United States well on his recent European trip. He is liked by three of every four Americans.</br></br>That is a summary of what White House pollster Richard Wirthlin???s surveys are reporting at the 18-month point of the Reagan presidency. The Wirthlin polls also suggest that Reagan has defused the nuclear freeze issue by his arms control initiatives and has generally improved his standing on foreign policy, even as it is slumping on economic performance.</br></br>But the public perception of the Reagan foreign policy, like the policy itself, is clouded by events in the Middle East. Two of three Americans think the U.S. response to the Israelis after the invasion of Lebanon was too weak even though the Palestine Liberation Organization has the lowest standing of any institution or individual</br></br>Overall, the dualism of Reagan???s standing with the electorate can be expressed in a single sentence: Three of 10 Americans who disagree with Reagan policies remain supportive of the president. In Wirthlin???s polls, as in some published surveys, Reagan???s standing has now inched upward to slightly above 50 percent after plummeting early in the year."

Negative,"THE POLITICIANS pay too little attention; the 1988 income and poverty figures just issued by the Census Bureau are bad news.</br></br>The longest sustained economic expansion in peacetime history has failed to drive the poverty rate back to the lows of the 1970s; the economy famous for lifting all boats no longer does so. Real per capita income was up, but this broadest measure of economic well-being is an average. As in other recent years, for the richest two-fifths of families median income and income share rose; for the poorest two-fifths they declined. The gap between rich and poor was the highest in the 40-odd years it has been measured.</br></br>The poverty rate was 13.1 percent, more than one American in eight, down only 0.3 percent from the year before. The bureau called that steady. For children, who made up 40 percent of the poor, the rate was 19.7 percent, the highest of any age group; for blacks, 31.6 percent; black children, 44.6 percent; Hispanics and Hispanic children, 26.8 percent and 37.9 percent. For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.</br></br>Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.</br></br>The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes. All four of these proposals are before Congress. Rejecting the first while enacting the others would move money from people who most emphatically do not need it to others who do."

Negative,"Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.</br></br>What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.</br></br>There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.</br></br>Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.</br></br>On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually."

Positive,"ONE OF the great feats of social engineering in the last 25 years has been a huge increase in the standard of living of the elderly. Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.</br></br>The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.</br></br>The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.</br></br>The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.</br></br>Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs. For recipients with incomes above, say, $40,000 a year, entitlements (including Social Security benefits and the insurance value of Medicare) would be progressively reduced, though never wiped out entirely."

Negative,"IT WAS BOUND to happen when the full force of the recession hit the pockets of this region???s governments, but today there is even more evidence that budget pressures are threatening to destroy Metro, the Council of Governments and other important city-suburban institutions, While some of the effects might not be felt immediately by the public, breakdowns in bus service, higher costs of transportation, delays in road projects and other costly setbacks could occur if disputes between the local governments aren???t resolved soon.</br></br>???

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1-1/16 points, and its yield fell to 6.62 percent from 6.72 percent late Friday.</br></br>The Dow, which fell 3 percent Friday, was up 2 percent today, closing at 5581.00, just 61 points below the high it set last Tuesday. Other indicators also were higher, and 1,568 stocks rose while 879 declined."
Positive,"NEW YORK, Dec. 5-Stocks rallied today, setting records forthe first time in nearly two months, as a surprisingly strong economic report eased worries about weak profits instead of spurring the usual attack of inflation jitters.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98,97 to 8149.13,just llOpoints shy of its alltime best dose of 8259.31 on Aug. 6. But the highlight of the rally was the return to record levels by the Standard & Poor's 509stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index. The two broad-market measures closed at record highs for the first time since Oct 7, a few weeks before Wall Street succumbed to a global sell-off caused by an economic crisis in Asia.</br></br>For the week, the Dow gained 326 points, or more than 4 percent giving it a 26 percent gain for 1997 with less than a month to go. The S&P 500 and the NYSE composite are both up more than 30 percent this year.</br></br>Click on this symbol on The Washington Post's Internet site at http://www. washingtonpost.com to find: ment said the nation???s unemployment rate sank to a 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November as employers added 404,000 workers to their payrolls, nearly double what analysts had expected.</br></br>The report did, in feet, unnerve the inflation-sensitive bond market, but stock investors were heartened by the notion that an economy strong enough to create so many jobs might also be"
Positive,"The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said yesterday, indicating the expansion has enough steam to reach its fifth birthday this fall and become the second-longest in four decades.</br></br>The report led Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige to predict that the administration's forecast of 3.2 percent inflation-adjusted growth for all of 1987 ""surely"" was attainable.</br></br>The economy grew at an annualized 4.4 percent rate in the first three months of the year, according to newly revised figures for the gross national product. Its pace for the first half was a 3.5 percent rate.</br></br>""The economy's performance during the first half of the year suggests that we can achieve 3 percent growth over four quarters of 1987,"" Baldrige said. ""Conditions are favorable for growth during the second half.""</br></br>New statistical revisions also released yesterday by Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that the economy grew faster in 1984, 1985 and 1986 than had been previously reported. The stronger growth was fueled almost entirely by higher consumer spending, while business investment was lower than earlier thought. {Details on Page D10.}"
Negative,"NEW YORK, Starch 10 (AP)???Weakness in steels and motors spread to some other sections of the stock market today and left prices irregularly lower at the close.</br></br>In early trading, rails, aircraft-missiles and electronics scored fair-sized gains. By the finish stocks in these groups showed a wide smattering of plus and minus signs.</br></br>Aircraft-missiles attracted demand after news of a big air force order to Lockheed and published reports of a possible speed up in long range missile development.</br></br>Lockheed, up 11?? at one time, finished up ! 4. Boeing made a better gain at 114. Douglas moved ahead a small fraction.</br></br>The electronics moved along with the missiles. But by the finish Radio Corp. was off 11s, Texas Instruments 314 and Motorola 3. Even Philco, strong and active early, had its gain shaved to %."
Positive,"Job growth rose sharply in the Washington area in the first three months of the year, according to government statistics released yesterday, as the private sector finally started adding to its payrolls in large numbers.</br></br>The numbers are the strongest signal yet that the region's economy, which has been growing modestly in the past three years largely because of federal spending, is entering a more robust recovery, with companies in construction, retail, leisure and hospitality adding significant numbers of jobs.</br></br>The Washington area had 2.2 percent more jobs in March than a year earlier, a net gain of 60,600, after adding jobs at a 0.6 percent pace in 2003. The area's unemployment rate was 3 percent in March, the lowest of any major city and down from 3.2 percent in February and 3.7 percent in March 2003.</br></br>With both the government and private sectors now expanding at a healthy pace, some forecasters expect the Washington area to generate 80,000 jobs in 2004, on par with the boom years in the late 1990s.</br></br>""The recovery has strengthened and broadened,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia Corp. who is one such forecaster. ""That's an unabashed positive."""
Negative,"High interest rates are the stick that drove Congress and the White House to negotiate all spring over the budget and that may yet push Congress to take some action to reduce the upcoming deficit.</br></br>The theory is that lower prospective deficits will reduce pressure on the financial markets, reduce fear of future inflation, and for both reasons bring a reduction in interest rates that will let the economy off the floor of recession.</br></br>All sides agree that high interest rates are a leading cause of the economy???s problems. But there is lively disagreement about the rest of the equation: just what is keeping rates high now, and how best to bring them down without harming the economy in other ways.</br></br>President Reagan has himself been afflicted by this split in opinion. Thus he has said that the likely deficits over the next several years are keeping rates high, in part because they are raising inflationary expectations and leaving investors unwilling to lend except at extremely high rates. But he has also taken a contrary view and, citing cases in the Midwest where local banks have cut their rates, has argued that interest rates should come down because the inflation rate has come down so rquch in recent months.</br></br>There are several lines of argument against the interest rate theory on which the budget negotiators have been operating."
Negative,"Inflation took an unexpected leap in August as sharply higher energy prices and housing costs sent the consumer price index up 0.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.</br></br>It was the largest increase in the price index since January???s 0.7 percent rise. Over the last eight months, consumer prices have gone up 5.1 percent on an annual basis. In 1986, the index rose 1.1 percent.</br></br>Analysts said it was unlikely that prices would spiral quickly upward during the rest of the year, but cautioned that the weak inflation rates of 1986 are gone. Prices in 1987 and 1988 are forecast to go up by 4 percent to 4.5 percent.</br></br>In another disappointing report, the Commerce Department said yesterday that new factory orders for durable goods, a gauge of future business investment, fell 3.1 percent last month. The decline was the first since January.</br></br>Orders for nondefense capital goods, a component of the durable-goods indicator that also predicts business spending, fell 8.4 percent in August from the previous month."
Negative,"Wall Street wilted Tuesday as investors awaiting next week's Federal Reserve meeting remained uneasy that the fallout from the slumping housing market could bring more bank losses and drag the economy into recession.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 65.84, or 0.49 percent, to 13,248.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63, or 0.65 percent, to 1462.79, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 17.30, or 0.66 percent, to 2619.83.</br></br>Retreating oil prices and signs of strength in non-financial industries could not keep the stock market from declining for a second consecutive day. Investors have tiptoed into December, which is usually a winning month on Wall Street; most expect lower rates after the Fed meets Tuesday, but the size of the cut is under debate.</br></br>Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase downgraded major securities firms, warning that while further write-offs of bad mortgage debt might help the firms' stocks, longer-term concerns about their risk management might hurt their overall valuation. J.P. Morgan lowered its earnings estimates for some of Wall Street's biggest players: Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.</br></br>Those investment banks and other financial companies fell, including Washington Mutual, Citigroup, Bank of America, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and J.P. Morgan itself. The financial sector has been dragging on the broader market since the summer. A report by D.A. Davidson analysts said bank stocks are at three- to four-year lows."

Urban land prices, however, have been rising at an average rate of 6 per cent a year, according to Chase Manhattan Bank."
Negative,"Wholesale prices jumped in July at the fastest rate in more than a quarter-century, the Labor Department reported yesterday, furthering concerns about a continued increase in inflation at a time when economic activity has ebbed.</br></br>Stocks tumbled, with the Dow Jones industrial average posting its second straight triple-digit decline as the new government data suggested that an economic recovery may take longer than investors had expected.</br></br>""The economy faces more tough times ahead, which is uncomfortable for workers, businesses and investors,"" said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. ""But we're only going to have room to grow once inflation is contained, and unfortunately the slowdown we're in is what appears to be needed right now to keep inflation in check.""</br></br>Labor Department data showed that the cost of materials used by businesses increased 1.2 percent in July and has risen 9.8 percent in the past 12 months. It was the largest yearly increase since 1981, as businesses absorbed sharp cost increases for energy and other commodities.</br></br>The report followed recent news that consumer prices also are rising faster than expected -- and faster than the Federal Reserve's generally accepted target rate of around 2 percent. Although wholesale inflation does not necessarily translate into higher consumer prices, it can be indicative of things to come."
Negative,"Stocks suffered their biggest one-day drop in two years Friday as rising oil prices and surprisingly weak financial reports from blue- chip companies General Electric Co. and Citigroup Inc. spread gloom across Wall Street.</br></br>The selling began at the opening bell and mounted through the day, driving the Dow Jones industrial average down 213.32 points, or 2 percent, to 10,667.39. The blue-chip index, which last week broke 11,000 for the first time in more than four years, is now slightly below where it began the year.</br></br>The selling spread across the broader market as well. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.55 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 1261.49. Technology stocks plummeted as a Justice Department request for Web-searching information from Google Inc. pushed the company's stock down more than 8 percent, its biggest one- day drop ever. The Nasdaq fell 54.11, or 2.4 percent, to close at 2247.70.</br></br>Traders and money managers said the day's losses stemmed from a litany of grim news that mounted through the day. First, oil prices spiked on fears that international sanctions against Iran over its nuclear ambitions could shut down an important source of oil. A futures contract for a barrel of crude closed at $68.35 in New York on Friday, up $1.52, or 2.3 percent. A moderating oil price was among the main drivers of last year's fourth-quarter stock market rally.</br></br>""We are making another run at $70 a barrel, and we are doing it without a hurricane having knocked out 70 percent of U.S. production,"" said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, referring to last year's hurricane season. ""You couple that with the stark reminder of all the geopolitical jitters out there, and you wind up with investors wanting to get a little more defensive."""
Positive,"BOSTON???For the past five years I have celebrated Aug. 26, the anniversary of the passage of women???s suffrage, in my own kinky way. I have handed out awards to people for notable achievements in their fight against equality, harmony, peace and justice between the sexes.</br></br>Until now, I have called this the Annual Life Isn???t Fair Awards. This year, however, in commemoration of the defeat of the ERA, I have decided to rename this event. Henceforth, by popular demand, these coveted prizes will be known as the Equal Rites Awards. But enough of all this chatter when you are waiting breathlessly for the results.</br></br>The first award always goes, by protocol, to the president of the United States, a man who* believes in the E and the R but not the A. To him, for reasons too numerous to list, we send a hard-earned satin scarlet ???A??? for Affirmative re-Action.</br></br>But in all fairness, he must give up the Pig-male-ion of the Year Award, to be shared by those dozen state legislators in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina who defeated ERA, proving again that a majority does not always rule. To them, we send individual ballot boxes . . . empty.</br></br>The Knight in Shining Armor Prize for gallantry this year goes to another president, J.

This award is inscribed with his chivalrous remark at a Jaycee meeting: ???Would the woman please leave. I can???t teach leadership to a woman.???"
Positive,"It is an ancient debating technique: Caricature your opponent's argument, then knock down the straw man you created. In the 2004 campaign, Bush has been knocking down such phantoms on subjects from Iraq to free trade.</br></br>In a speech on May 21 mentioning the importance of integrity in government, business and the military, Bush veered into a challenge to unidentified ""people"" who practice moral relativism. ""It may seem generous and open-minded to say that everybody, on every moral issue, is equally right,"" Bush said, at Louisiana State University. ""But that attitude can also be an excuse for sidestepping life's most important questions.""</br></br>On May 19, Bush was asked about a plan by his Democratic opponent, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), to halt shipments that are replenishing emergency petroleum reserves. Bush replied by saying we should not empty the reserves -- something nobody in a responsible position has proposed. ""The idea of emptying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would put America in a dangerous position in the war on terror,"" Bush said. ""We're at war.""</br></br>The president has used a similar technique on the stump, when explaining his decision to go to war in Iraq in light of the subsequent failure to find stockpiles of forbidden weapons. In the typical speech, Bush explains the prewar intelligence indicating Saddam Hussein had such weapons, and then presents in inarguable conclusion: ""So I had a choice to make: either trust the word of a madman, or defend America. Given that choice, I will defend America every time.""</br></br>Missing from that equation is the actual choice Bush confronted: support continued U.N. weapons inspections, or go to war."
Positive,"Economists and government officials are increasingly worried that in its efforts to restrain the U.S. economy's current boom, the Federal Reserve may boost interest rates so much that it produces a mild bust next year or in 1996.</br></br>The Fed, which has already raised interest rates six times this year in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the red-hot economy, could act again at a policy-making session today. But analysts said the central bank is more likely to wait until it meets next on Jan. 31.</br></br>Many analysts now predict that to curb the economy's robust growth, the Fed will have to provide such a harsh dose of interest rate medicine - raising short-term interest rates at least a percentage point on top of this year's increases of 2.5 percentage points - that it will eventually plunge the economy into recession.</br></br>""There is less and less chance of a soft landing and a higher and higher chance of the more traditional boom-and-bust cycle,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.</br></br>In its latest forecast, Merrill Lynch & Co. said last week that strong economic growth in early 1995 could lead the Fed to raise rates ""by more than we currently expect. In that case, the U.S. economy would probably decelerate more sharply by late 1995 and possibly into a recession in 1996."""
Negative,"The U.S. trade deficit rose to an all-time high of $61 billion in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, dealing a fresh blow to hopes that the gap will start to shrink soon in response to the decline in the dollar.</br></br>Exports stayed relatively flat, totaling $100.5 billion in February, just 0.1 percent, or $100 million, above the previous month's level. At the same time, the nation's pattern of importing more and more goods continued unchecked, as foreign products purchased by Americans rose 1.6 percent, or $2.6 billion, to $161.5 billion, led by oil, autos and consumer goods.</br></br>The politically sensitive U.S. deficit with China narrowed in February to $13.9 billion from January's $15.3 billion level. But critics of China pointed out that the combined figure for those two months was 47 percent above the same period last year and said the report will fuel growing sentiment in Congress for a tougher policy on Beijing's trade practices.</br></br>The overall gap was a record -- by itself nothing new, because the monthly trade deficit has smashed through previous highs eight times since the start of last year. But yesterday's report deepened concern that the flow of goods across U.S. borders does not seem to be responding to the dollar's fall, even though that decline has continued for three years.</br></br>A cheaper dollar is supposed to spur sales of U.S. exports by making American goods more attractive to foreign purchasers, and reduce Americans' appetite for foreign products by making them more expensive. Together with some private economists, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted late last year that the move in the currency would start to exert an effect on trade flows and shrink the gap in months to come. So far, however, signs of such a development have been scant."
Positive,"The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate, a key short-term interest rate, by another quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent on Thursday, but economists and analysts questioned yesterday whether it would be enough to light a fire under the faltering U.S. economy.</br></br>Like a brakeman on a runaway train, the Fed is credited with stopping the economy from falling into a deeper decline by aggressively cutting rates more than 3 percentage points since the recession began in August 1990.</br></br>But with the monetary tools available to Alan Greenspan and his colleagues, it took months to stop the slide.</br></br>Now, according to George Eads, chief economist for General Motors Corp. and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter administration, more - much more - is needed.</br></br>""For products like ours people have to have both the ability to buy and the willingness to buy,"" Eads said. ""Rate cuts provide a little bit of help because they cut payments a little. Consumers are telling us they want interest rate cuts. But it's got to be a very large cut to get people's attention."
Positive,"After two months in which bad weather held down hiring, U.S. businesses and governments added nearly a half-million workers to payrolls last month???about double what many analysts had expected???as the nation???s unemployment rate held steady at 6.5 percent.</br></br>Yesterday???s unexpectedly strong Labor Department report caused interest rates to continue their recent sharp upward march. Rates on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds reached 7.26 percent, more than a full percentage point above their level at the beginning of February when bond prices started their tumble.</br></br>Bond investors and traders took the report as a sign the economy is growing so fast that it will cause inflation to worsen and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates significantly. To protect themselves against those possibilities, investors demanded higher rates before they would commit their money.</br></br>Some analysts said they expected yesterday???s rise in interest rates to trigger another large sell-off when the stock market, which was closed yesterday in observance of Good Friday, opens Monday.</br></br>Yesterday???s bond market decline again illustrates how news of a strengthening economy can rattle financial markets already in a bearish mood. That is largely because investors and traders fear that strong economic growth will lead to higher inflation and interest rates???two things that invariably unsettle markets. [See story, Page D12.)"

Brady, the investment banker who directed a study of last October???s stock market collapse for President Reagan, warned Congress yesterday that the market could collapse again unless swift action is taken to reform some of its rules and practices.</br></br>Brady told members of the Senate Banking Committee that Congress should pressure the securities industry to adopt immediate reforms and needs to be ready to overhaul stock market regulation through legislation.</br></br>???We must act to prevent a reoccurrence of the events of October,"" said Brady, who runs Dillon, Read & Co. ???We are looking down the barrel, and the gun is still loaded.""</br></br>Shortly after Brady testified, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a 2???A-inch-thick study of the October market collapse. Its primary conclusion was that steps need to be taken to diminish volatility???violent swings in prices.</br></br>Brady reiterated his view that the Federal Reserve Board???s authority over the nation???s financial markets should be expanded on key issues, including trading halts and minimum financial requirements, or margins, for investors."
